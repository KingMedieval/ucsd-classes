Materials are at the foundation for all of engineering, as evident by the latest products that we design, to the airplanes that we fly, to the latest smartphones. In fact, breakthroughs with material research are often accompanied by rapid advancements in technology. Thus, it is paramount for all engineers to have an understanding of the structure and behavior of materials. In this class, we focus on the structure of materials, the microstructure connection to mechanical properties, and, ultimately, failure mechanisms. Materials play an important role in both design and manufacturing, which will be addressed in the context of components and extreme environments. Of specific interest will be defects within materials, defect formation/evolution, and their role in strengthening mechanisms. Material anisotropy, micromechanisms, and elasto-plastic properties at the atomic, single-crystal/constituent, and polycrystal-material levels and their use in explaining the deformation and failure characteristics in metals, polymers, and ceramics; failure mechanisms and toughening in composites; structure and behavior of aerospace materials: metal alloys, ceramic-matrix composites, and fiber-reinforced polymer composites. Particular topics will also include: elastic deformation, dislocation mechanics, plastic deformation and strengthening mechanisms, creep, and failure mechanisms; design criteria; special topics. We will attempt to have minimal overlap with AAE 55400, Fatigue of Structures and Materials. Therefore we will not cover fracture, fatigue, or stress concentrators.",

It is designed to provide an academic overview of the field of multicultural education as it evolved to this day. The course will offer an introductory overview of the many differences that exist within all human beings. Because the diversity among individuals is endless, we cannot study all differences, but will study a sampling such as race, ethnicity, gender identity, age, social class, disability, learning styles, and religion/spiritual orientation. Issues of poverty, language, and social justice may also be examined in relationship to the above major areas of emphasis.",

We will explore reactions to, and the results of, the spread of American culture both inside and outside the United States. By studying traditional cultural forms like art, music, design, literature, film, and technology the course will build a foundation from which to understand the configuration of American culture. Yet the course will also emphasize American culture expression, that in the forms of television, advertising, sport, cartoons, social media, video games, fashion, food, drugs, and automobiles, have transcended the geographical boundaries of the United States to engage in global interplays of material cultural exchange.",

This progress is the result of improved observational techniques that have resulted in high resolution images of very distant galaxies, a more accurate mapping of the Large Scale Structure of the Universe or the high resolution picture of the young universe provided by Cosmic Microwave Background observations. We will present a historical perspective of how ideas and data have shaped Cosmology through the centuries. In addition, we will review the theoretical models that are in agreement with the current observations. Our goal will be to provide the students with a broad overview of the current research in Cosmology with an eye toward stimulating the students curiosity about the many questions still awaiting answers in this field.",

The various disciplines in the life sciences are generating a wealth of experimental and annotation data. Today's graduate students need experience with modern tools that can help them to access, explore, analyze, interpret and manage the data that they generate in the lab. Students will use the R programming language and packages from Bioconductor, the R bioinformatics project, as their principal tools for this course. Students will develop workflows in R that bridge established algorithms for bioinformatics such as limma, edgeR or DESeq2, incorporating methods to import, QC, transform and visualize genome-scale datasets derived from next generation sequencing experiments. A critical aspect of bioinformatics that is often inadequate is workflow documentation. This course will use Rmarkdown to integrate computer code, data and results to manage complex bioinformatics projects. The class has lecture, lab and distance components. Lectures will focus on the theoretical and biological aspects of bioinformatics analysis using recent examples from the literature. In lab, students will work on programming exercises or projects using published datasets. Advanced students will also have the opportunity to work with their own data. Distance instruction will include R tutorials and videos that students can work through at their own pace (subject to completion deadlines). Particular emphasis will be placed on the theoretical and practical limitations of next generation sequencing data. No prior computer programming experience is required, but it is assumed that students have a firm grasp of the fundamental principles of molecular biology and how they relate to complex processes such as gene expression and genome organization.

Topics will include understanding the evolutionary organization of genes (genomics), the structure and function of gene products (proteomics), and the dynamics of gene expression in biological processes (transcriptomics). Inherently, bioinformatics is interdisciplinary, melding various applications of computational science with biology. This jointly taught course introduces analytical methods from biology, statistics and computer science that are necessary for bioinformatics investigations. The course is intended for junior and senior undergraduates from various science backgrounds. Our objective is to develop the skills of both tool users and tool designers in this important new field of research.",

The first part covers basic concepts, terminology, procedures and computations of control systems including block diagrams & transfer functions, open-loop & closed-loop control, control system modeling, time response, root locus techniques, design via root locus, and digital control systems. The second part focuses on issues surrounding the building controls: interfacing components such as sensors and actuators, problems encountered, and state-of-the-art solutions for building energy efficiency and thermal comfort. The third part aims to develop students' ability to convert control system concepts into real building control systems. The course provides a hands-on opportunity for students to complete three projects associated with the three primary components during the semester: indoor environmental quality assessment, building HVAC system commissioning and its control analysis, and new control algorithm development for building energy efficiency, occupant health, and individual productivity.",

Techniques are drawn from multiple schools of thought such as business, design, engineering, and the social sciences. Over the course of the term, multidisciplinary student teams directly apply cumulative learning to address a real-world complex societal challenge in close collaboration with a partner organization in an experiential learning format. The course can be counted toward the College of Engineering Minor in Innovation and Transformational Change and the Burton D.

A thorough understanding of how game engines work is therefore a requisite element of the game development process and lever for research in most domains involving interactive simulations and games. As game engine development, research, and application is a large and complex topic, the course is split into two semesters of study. The two courses are structured similarly but cover different aspects of development on and within game engines. This course introduces students to the fundamental technologies and skills required to develop video games using a modern game engine. Students are taught using a student-led, active-learning pedagogy in which students co-develop and present lectures, demonstrations, and assignments for their peers, with facilitation by the course instructor. The focus of this course is primarily on the technical, functional, and theoretical dimensions of game development, prioritizing technical soundness over design and creativity (which are covered more explicitly in a separate course). As research in this field continues to rapidly iterate, the latest findings are incorporated into each new offering of the course, refreshing its content as the technology evolves in its implementation and theoretical underpinnings. Production of original research focused upon an aspect of game development or game engine design is required.",

Visual analytics is the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces that synthesize human and computational ability to attack large complex problems. It is concerned with analytical reasoning, interaction, data transformations, data visualization, analytic reporting, and technology transition. While the different visual analytics applications share common theories and strategies, each of them has its unique data composition, visual representations, and analytical needs and strategies. Through survey and study a broad range of visual analytics applications, students will be able to apply visual analytics on their own applications, analyze and break down a complex analytical problem into proper components and steps, evaluate different visual analytic techniques and strategies, and finally design and develop an effective visual analytics solution toward the problem.",

The topics covered in the course include the structure of the operations decision hierarchy, role of online process measurements, elements of sensor network design, information systems to support process operations, plant data reconciliation, detection and diagnosis of process faults, plant wide control, real time process optimization, production planning and scheduling, and supply chain management. Each topic will be addressed by first summarizing the basic role and scope of that component, then discussing the structure of the decision problem, and then will outline some representative tools available to address that decision problem. Each major topic will include a lecture given by an industrial practitioner who will offer a perspective on the state of industrial practice. Permission of instructor required.",

Two practical benefits of randomization are its simplicity and speed. Deep and important computational complexity connections have been developed,  from bridging the gap between discrete and continuous optimization, bypassing deterministic barriers in online settings, summarizing massive data in polylogarithmic space, probabilistically checkable proofs, privacy enhancing techniques, modeling the web and other large networks, and sparsifying and compressing complicated combinatorial structures such as graphs. Randomization is an essential  key ingredient in the algorithmic breakthroughs today and in the future. This course presents the basic concepts in the design and analysis of randomized algorithms and shows how to apply them to algorithms for a wide range of problems. The course covers a broad range of problems benefitting from randomized computation including data structures, graph algorithms, online algorithms, geometric algorithms, streaming algorithms, derandomization techniques, and tools for probabilistic analysis of algorithms.",

In this course, we will explore how various components of ecosystems can be modeled following principles of biology, physics, and chemistry. We will also examine techniques for using modeling to study: 1) responses of the structure and functioning of ecosystems to changing climate, atmospheric composition, environmental conditions, and human activities; and 2) exchanges of major greenhouse gases (e.g., CO2, CH4, and N2O) between the atmosphere and the biosphere. During the course, we will go through the whole cycle of system modeling approach including model conceptualization, formulation, parameterization, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, verification, and application.",

Students will explore a variety of evidence-based strategies, tools, and curriculum models that effectively meet the diverse needs of all learners. Through readings, online classroom meetings and discussions, case studies, differentiated instruction examples, direct application and reflection, students will deepen their understanding and need to differentiate. With an overarching goal of increasing achievement and developing student talents, this course includes the following major components: creating positive learning environments that support a) high-quality curriculum; b) diagnostic, formative and summative assessments to inform instructional decision-making; and c) flexible grouping addressing student differences in readiness, interest, and learning profile (including learning preference, intelligence preference, gender, culture, language preference, locale, and opportunities to learn) and appreciating how these differences influence the ways in which students learn. Understanding that process of differentiation involves modifying content, process, product, learning environment, and/or affect incorporating higher-order thinking skills, creative problem solving, project-based learning, authentic/respectful tasks, collaborative learning, and other evidence-based strategies to promote student achievement and talent development understanding how differentiation of curriculum and instruction fits within specific educational interventions and models, such as scaffolding, flexible grouping, Response to Intervention (Rtl), and Multi-Tiered System of Support(MTSS). Effective teachers do more than teach content; they teach unique individuals who enter classrooms with various levels of expertise, skills, abilities, social-emotional needs, and learning expectations. Effective teachers differentiate curriculum by personalizing content based on the particular needs and interests of their students. Effective teachers differentiate instruction by applying various grouping strategies, technology applications and thinking skills. The goal of every effective teacher is that every child learns something new every day. Cannot be taken concurrently with EDPS 24000.",

The course analyzes disciplinary differences in approaching the ethical, the human, and environmental problems such as sustainability, development, biodiversity, global security, and climate change. Students will explore what it means to be ethical in and through an interrogation of our contemporary conceptions of what it means to be human. These interrogations in turn will prompt us to reconsider human creations such as knowledge, culture, and technology, which will push us to genuinely think how humans as a species situate their creations within the realm of what they call Nature. Students will be introduced to the history of environmental studies in the discipline, to the rise of what is now known as \"postcolonial ecocriticism\" to theoretical inquiry into modern technology, and to other recent developments in the fields of environmental studies.",

Approached from a multi-disciplinary perspective this course brings together gene, brain, and behavioral sciences with the aim of developing a better understanding of autism. The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associated with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of impact of ASD on the family and society.",

        "description": "This course is designed to help students more effectively manage self, peers, teams, clients and firms in diverse organizational settings and lead change. People and leaders in organizations are constantly working with members of different backgrounds, social identities, and experiences, fostering increased attention to diversity and inclusion in an employment and organizational context. [1] For example, women represent over half of the labor for 57% (BLS, 2018) [2] but are severely under-represented at senior management levels and in high-paying technical and professional fields (Kossek & Buzzanell, 2018) [3]. Ethnic and racial minorities are also severely under-represented. The U.S. population is increasingly diverse as 40% of the population identifies as racial or ethnic minorities (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2019) including African-American (13.4%), Hispanic-American (18.3%), Asian-American (5.9%), American Indian or Alaska Native (1.3%), and European American (60%) as well as a growing number of individuals who identify with more than one race or ethnicity (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2019) [4]. Further, 26% of the population has some form of disability, and 16% are over the age of 65 (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2018). Many other minority groups can face workplace marginalization challenges such as veterans, minority religious group members (Muslims, Jews, Hinduism; Catholic; Latter-day Saints), immigrants, people with mental or intellectual disabilities, & LGBTQ persons (Stone, Lukaszewski, & Dulebohn, 2020)[5]. When leveraged effectively, these differences in social identity and values can help attract and retain talent, strengthen societal and community economic equality, support organizational and team effectiveness; but when overlooked, or mismanaged, these differences can increase turnover, conflict, stress, talent under-utilization, and harm career and work-life well-being, and productivity. The class focuses on management of gender and diversity for inclusion and equity from an individual employee, leader and team/organizational perspective in a workplace context. The goal of this class is to take a multi-level approach to help you learn how to lead the management of diversity and inclusion through a) improving your ability to work in diverse teams, as well as b) developing your ability to lead, develop, and implement strategies to foster cultural and structural change to support the management of gender and diversity toward enhanced organizational effectiveness. Men, as well as women, majority and minority individuals, will be able to leverage the skills taught in this course when making their own career decisions, as well as when managing, being managed by, or collaborating with others; or leading and changing organizations to support new ways of working. We integrate multiple levels and lenses to understand diversity and inclusion. From an individual leadership perspective, we tackle the question: \"Why does diversity matter in employing organizations and business, what is the state-of-the-art evidence-based knowledge, and what does it mean to me personally in my career and my leadership beliefs.\" Specifically, we focus on the business and social science processes - including attitudes toward in-groups and out-groups, stereotyping, identity, privilege, and power, intersectionality, discrimination, bias, equity influence opportunity, bystander awareness, and perspective taking - this affects how members of different social groups perceive and interact with one another. Since managing social identity increasingly involves managing work-life boundaries and work and non-work public and private selves, we will also learn about authenticity choices and social and public/professional identity boundary management. From an organizational and group perspective, we address the question: \"What are best practices for successful diversity management?\" We will focus on organizational and institutional structures and cultures and their relations to strategies for creating diversity through management practices; how to create an inclusive culture and positive climate for inclusion and talent management, and developing and retaining diverse talent and foster innovation and organizational effectiveness across multiple levels of intervention (individual, group, intergroup, organizational, and societal). We discuss how to conduct an organizational diagnosis of the current diversity climate and barriers and facilitators for creating a multicultural workplace and a flexible environment supportive of many identities, and how assumptions may vary across industry and cultural contexts.",

We also discuss important areas defined in PMI's PMBOK, like scope, time, cost and quality management. Next we look at how IT projects have traditionally been managed, and move on to the study of agile methods. We go through some of the most important aspects of agile project management, such as user stories, agile teams an agile planning, execution and tracking. In learning these tools and techniques, we take a hands-on approach wherever possible and use project management software, exercises and case studies.",

The course will start with an overview of linear elastic mechanics, move to rubber elasticity, and then viscoelasticity (concentrating on time-temperature superposition). We will also cover fluid dynamics and the rheology of non-Newtonian fluids. We will conclude with a section on deformation, yield, and fracture mechanisms (focusing on those phenomena that are unique to polymers such as rubber cavitation, drawing, and crazing).",

The course will be focused on learning physical science by doing science i.e. developing understanding by collaborative activities and discussion in the laboratory and lecture and communicating your ideas to others. The course will have one 50-minute lecture and two 110-minute laboratory meetings each week. The course content is consistent with the CAEP (Council for the Accreditation of Education Preparation) K-6 Elementary Teacher Preparation Standards (Standard 2: Understanding and Applying Content and Curricular  Knowledge for Teaching in Physical Science and Engineering Design) and the NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards) Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs) for the Physical Sciences (Physical Sciences PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4) as well as many of the Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs). The course will be divided into four units: 1) Matter and Interactions 2) Motion and Stability 3) Energy and 4) Waves and their applications. All of these units will be delivered through the paradigm of solving engineering design problems. Engineering design involves many different practices: problem definition, model development and use, investigation, analysis and interpretation of data, application of mathematics and computational thinking, and determination of solutions.",

The view taken in this course is that to understand current processes of globalization we need to examine it in less broad and amorphous ways by focusing on its specific manifestations. Thus, this course focuses on how China has managed the challenges of globalization. China is a particularly useful case study because it failed the challenges of globalization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For an ancient civilization such as China, this failure had tremendous impact on its national pride. The Chinese refer to this historical juncture as the \"century of shame.\" Towards the end of the 20th century and the onset of the 21st, China faced again the challenges of globalization and has arisen to the tasks in a spectacular fashion, transforming a largely rural and agriculture economy into the world's second largest economic power. This amazing transformation is leading some to proclaim that the 21st century will belong to China!",

The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history of ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associated with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of impact of ASD on the family and society.",

The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of impact of ASD on the family and society.",

In this course, we will examine the emergence of race and ethnicity as concepts, and how they shape our everyday lives. We will be guided by the following questions: Why do we study race and ethnicity? How and why are they relevant in our society? How do we experience race and ethnicity, and how has this changed over time? Topics include multiculturalism and diversity; media representations; racism and discrimination; colorism; racial hierarchies; immigration; and different domains of racial inequality.",

This course will introduce you to the study of global development and globalization. The primary questions we will address are: What is development? What is globalization and what is its relationship with development? How have the processes of global development produced inequalities among nations, regions, races, genders, and classes? Is there a \"developing\" world and a \"developed\" world? If so, what are their differences and how do they relate with each other? How have some developing countries become more developed than others? What roles do corporations, the state, and civil society organizations play in the processes of global development? How is global development interrelated with the physical environment, inequalities of consumption, and the environmental crisis? How do people resist the inequalities and perceived injustices of global development through global social movements? How are we interconnected economically, politically, culturally, socially, and ecologically with people all over the world? What are the possible futures of development? To address these issues, our focus will be on the developing world, our scope will be global and long-term, our methodology will be historical-comparative, and our perspective will be social-scientific and critical.",

Among issues to be discussed are the estimation of the models, the testing of hypotheses, and the checking of model adequacy.

Topics include: the fundamentals of Bayesian inference for single and multiparameter models, regression, hierarchical models, model checking, approximation of a posterior distribution by iterative and non-iterative sampling methods, and Bayesian nonparametrics. Specific topics and the course outline are subject to change as the semester progresses. All topics will be motivated by problems from the physical, life, social, and management sciences.

The course exploits the broad expertise of the four faculty members by treating these challenges from diverse disciplinary perspectives, from the biological and physical sciences, to the social sciences, to engineering. By way of a set of case studies, students will analyze the features of these challenges which make them complex, and seek to explain and find solutions to the problems that arise in each case. Their treatment of the cases will be informed by published research and computer simulation. Students will actively participate in discussions regarding these global challenges, and contribute to the progress of the class using oral and written presentations. The course will culminate with a final project completed by teams composed of students from different disciplines.",

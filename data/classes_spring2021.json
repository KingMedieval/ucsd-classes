This course introduces stress wave propagation in solids, which is the foundation to characterization and understanding of high-rate response of materials. Then, the theoretical background and working principles of high-rate experimental methods are presented to characterize the material response under high-rate loading conditions. Finally, rate-dependent material models are introduced to describe the dynamic material behavior and deformation mechanisms. Typically offered Fall.",

        "description": "The usage of materials is the backbone of engineering practice. Yet, advances in materials have stagnated due to overly conservative approaches, trial-and-error testing, and long qualification times. Material modeling offers tremendous opportunities to address these issues. This class offers advanced modeling strategies at the intersection of mechanics and materials science for both polycrystalline and composite materials. The course topics are defined as follows: First, advanced micromechanics analysis of modern engineering materials with emphasis on relating elastic microstructural phenomena to the mechanics of material behavior, via the Eshelby inclusion problem and its application to fiber reinforced composites. Second, classical plasticity is summarized via phenomenological and mathematical formulation of the constitutive laws, including yielding, yield surface; von Mises, Tresca yield criteria; Drucker's stability postulate; strain or work hardening, normality rule, perfect plasticity, and stress-strain law. Third, crystal plasticity is discussed, specifically physical and mathematical foundation for plasticity in crystalline materials, with a detailed description of the Bishop and Hill implementation of the Taylor model for deformation of polycrystals. Lastly, concepts of dislocations leading to strengthening mechanisms in metals are discussed: (i) by studying the anisotropy of material and elastoplastic properties at crystal level, microstructural basis for deformation in metals, polymers, and ceramics and (ii) failure mechanisms and toughening in metals, with primary emphasis on work/strain hardening, solid solution hardening, precipitate hardening, and grain boundaries. The course will be comprised of three projects, where the student chooses the topic of the third and final project. Prerequisite: AAE 55300 or equivalent. Typically offered Spring.",

We will examine ways in which American Culture shaped and was shaped by international relationships that transcend nation states. We will explore reactions to, and the results of, the spread of American culture both inside and outside the United States. By studying traditional cultural forms like art, music, design, literature, film, and technology the course will build a foundation from which to understand the configuration of American culture. Yet the course will also emphasize American culture expression, that in the forms of television, advertising, sport, cartoons, social media, video games, fashion, food, drugs, and automobiles, have transcended the geographical boundaries of the United States to engage in global interplays of material cultural exchange.

        "description": "The course will revolve around genomics, the science and technology involved in determining the sequence of the entire DNA complement in an organism.  Almost everyone has heard of the human genome project, but fewer are aware of the spectacular technical progress in this field and the fact that many thousands of genomes have been sequenced.  Until recently, most of these have been microorganisms, but technological and computational progress has made it progressively easier and cheaper to sequence the genomes of higher organisms.  This field may have more of an impact on your future lives than almost any other field of the life sciences -  mostly because it touches on all areas of study.  The course will focus on the impact that genomes will have in selected areas.  It will begin with a basic understanding of the science and technology that gave rise to our current capabilities in sequencing and the fact that technology continues to provide greater capacity and cheaper prices.  You will soon see that every field in the College of  Science is well represented in the science and technology.  We will then go on to see how genomics influences many topics that affect our daily lives and can possibly provide answers to some critical questions (or at least pose better questions):  What is the basis of personalized medicine?  What does genomics tell us about the genealogy of mankind?  What impact will genomics have on our future food supply and our ability to feed a population of 9 billion people? What is the human microbiome and what does that mean to me?  Similarly, what is the gut microbiome, the mouthmicrobiome, etc? What impact will genomics have on the development of alternative energy sources, especially biofuels? In every area, we will discuss the scientific challenges, but also the ethical and societal implications.  In most cases, there is no one right answer, but a series of choices that can be guided by ethical considerations.  Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

The emphasis of this first section will be on the general strategies used by viruses to establish and maintain infection in a population.  In the second section, we will discuss in relative detail our current understanding of select important human viruses including influenza, HIV, smallpox, the herpesviruses, and tumor-causing viruses.  The objective of this section will be to understand how the unique aspects of each virus's biology affect the outcome of infection with these pathogens.  In addition to virus-associated diseases, we will discuss potential ways that viruses may provide symbiotic benefits to their hosts and thereby shape the course of human evolution.  Throughout the course, we will emphasize societal and political aspects of virology and virus-derived technologies, including vaccine development, the use of viruses as gene therapy vectors, and the threat of viral bioterror of bio-error.

This course is part of a three-course series dealing with various aspect of regulatory science. Regulatory science considers the scientific and technical foundations that support the practical testing and regulations that ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. This course covers the responsible conduct of clinical and pre-clinical research, including evaluation of device tissue interactions and how they may be studied with pre-clinical animal models to predict safety and performance in human clinical trials that are necessary to gain regulatory approval for marketing. In the section on ethics we will cover several topics related to responsible conduct of clinical and pre-clinical research, including informed consent, risk assessment and ethical decisions, IRB oversight and ethical study design.

The intent is to show students that they probably already have a model in their heads, and they just don't know it! Few biologists realize that when they can draw a picture of their system, or explain important pathways in words, that this is a model. From there, it isn't hard to start some basic math. The course will be a broad overview of different techniques that can be used to model biological systems. Each lecture topic in this course could itself form an entire course, so students will not complete the course as experts in mathematical modeling. Instead, the objectives are to: 1) expose students to a number of tools in mathematical modeling; 2) give students some practical experience with these tools; and 3) develop a component of their thesis research into a model.

Course content includes market analysis techniques to link technology attributes to opportunity and vice versa, combinatorial business design and planning methods, strategic innovation theories, competitive analysis, methods of emergent strategy and risk mitigation, as well as examination of team building, firm influence and navigation, and organizational design principles. Emphasis throughout is placed on the implications of research and development uncertainty, long-lifecycle economics, and the management of subcontracts and multi-disciplinary teams often encountered when developing and delivering complex engineering outputs. Case studies are used to contrast the challenges faced when creating new businesses (entrepreneurial) with those encountered in attempts to grow an existing enterprise (intrapreneurial). Coursework and project activities also facilitate development of business acumen, and skill building in conceptual thinking, synthesis, and persuasive communication. This course is particularly relevant for engineering students intending to progress into managerial roles in technology or R&D driven organizations. This course can be counted toward the College of Engineering Minor in Innovation and Transformational Change and the Burton D.

The course focuses on the principles, tools, and procedures used in the design-build project delivery method. It provides students with sufficient education to become certified (following additional examination) by the Design Build Institute of America as an Associate Member and dependent on employment experience, a full Member. Traditional project delivery methods, Design-Bid-Build, Construction Manager as Agent, `Fast Track', and other `rip and read' methods are losing popularity to project delivery methods that take a more collaborative approach. Collaboration requires a different way of thinking about a capital construction project and working with others in project delivery. Constructors must move from a transactional, arms-length relationship where the project is viewed as a low-price commodity to a full-suite delivery of services resulting in a high-value product. This requires collaboration with the Owner and other members of the project delivery process, something that has been missing from traditional project delivery methods. Active student participation is required. Student participation will be facilitated through assigned presentations, in-class projects, field trips to local projects, and guest lectures. Students who complete the course and achieve DBIA's minimum requirements (Fundamentals of Project Delivery, Principles of Design-Building Project Delivery, Post Award, and Contracts & Risk Management) will be eligible for recognition by DBIA.

Students are taught using student-led, active-learning pedagogy in which students co-develop and present lectures, demonstrations, and assignments for their peers, with the facilitation of the course instructor. A thorough understanding of how game engines work is therefore a requisite element of the game development process and lever for research in most domains involving interactive simulations and games. As game engine development, research, and application is a large and complex topic, the course material is distributed across two semesters. In addition to the continuation of technical topics this course also emphasizes the experiential, conceptual, and aesthetic dimensions of game development, prioritizing implementation completeness with creative, aesthetically-pleasing implementations that are informed by current research. As research in this field continues to rapidly iterate, the latest findings are incorporated into each new offering of the course, refreshing its content as the technology evolves in its implementation and theoretical underpinnings. Production of original research focused upon an aspect of game development or game engine design is required. Permission of instructor required. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

Special emphasis will be placed on connections between biochemical principles and the fields of medicine, human health and disease, nutrition and biotechnology. This course should serve as excellent preparation for higher-level biochemistry courses as well as standardized pre-health professional exams. CHM 33900 was designed as the 4lh semester of the 1-2-1 competency-based curriculum transformation in chemistry as it applies to pre-health professional and life science students at Purdue.

Emphasis is on the unity of the phenomena that underlie the preparation, manipulation, and analysis of ion and electron beams and on the analogies between inelastic reactions of ions and electrons, including those with both gaseous and solid targets. Mass spectrometry is covered in some depth, and a number of newer aspects of particle spectroscopy are treated, including ion scattering spectrometry, Rutherford scattering, energy loss spectrometry (ion and electron), ion kinetic energy spectrometry, ion cyclotron resonance and Auger spectrometry. Applications of these techniques feature structural analysis (compositions of mixtures, molecular structure of organics, electronic state assignment in simple ions), chemical preparations (ion implantation), and isotopic analysis. The underlying chemistry is explored, particularly in considering the kinetics and dynamics of unimolecular fragmentation and in terms of the factors that affect the cross-sections of inelastic collisions.

A broad survey of readings guides an in-depth study of fundamental theories of development and knowledge generation as it relates to pedagogy and research. A rich body of theoretical literature will be studied in order to explore its relation to engineering education. Work in the course aims to construct answers to the following three questions: (1) How do theories of human learning, development, and epistemology help us think about engineering? (2) How do they relate to engineering education? (3) How do they inform research method and practice in engineering education? No restrictions. It is helpful, however, for students to have engaged in prior reading-and writing- intensive courses that required them to synthesize large amounts of information. For this reason, it is recommended that students are enrolled currently in a graduate program at Purdue University. Permission of department required. Typically offered Spring.",

The course covers valuation of securities using modern martingale methods as well as the necessary parameter estimation and numerical methods such as Monte Carlo simulations. Applications will include derivatives such as options on stocks, bonds and currencies, as well as valuation of defaultable securities, and modeling the term structure of interest rates and risk management with Value-at-Risk.

To achieve these goals, student engagement in class sessions, and willingness to share perspectives and opinions, and application of course readings and materials, are critical to the success of this course.

        "description": "This course is designed for all philosophy majors, but is open to anyone interested in minor/majoring in philosophy. The format for this course is based on three components: reading and reflection, along with in-class discussion; in-class guest speakers who will address various topics in philosophy as a field, and/or professionalization (both within and outside of academia); and short written exercises, often done in class, which are designed to build up to the final project. Most classes will begin with a guest speaker giving a brief introduction to a particular area or topic within philosophy. Students will have a short reading assigned for each class period that will be discussed with the instructor following the guest's presentation. The course readings will be, as best as possible, related to the area/topic introduced by the guest. Certain classes will be dedicated solely to career/professionalization interests and will feature guests with expertise in these areas. The professionalization experts will help students develop their career goals, identify possible internships and scholarships to pursue while a student at Purdue, and develop career goals for after they have graduated. Finally, certain classes will be dedicated to writing and the development of the final project, which will include a proposed 8-semester path of study, a polished resume/CV, and career/professionalization goals.

        "description": "Writing is a primary mode of communication in philosophy, perhaps the primary mode. This course aims to prepare students for the writing demands of philosophy by having students develop their ability to analyze, interpret, and critique philosophical arguments through written works and, in the process, construct their own philosophical arguments. Students will also learn writing processes that will aid their ability to effectively and clearly compose philosophical arguments, including outlining, drafting, and editing. Finally, the class will also pay attention to genre and rhetorical features of philosophical discourse, such as how philosophers enact criticism and write introductions to research papers. Students can use their course paper as a draft of a writing sample for PhD programs. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

Specifically, the course is designed to introduce students to the appropriate selection and use of nonprescription medications and devices for the treatment of minor health complaints by patients.  A principle theme throughout the course is that the solution of all self-care problems (i.e., regardless of the context in which they occur) involves the application of the same basic problem solving process.  Course activities, readings and homework assignments will provide students with illustration of how the problem solving process can be applied to specific self-care situations that arise in practice.  Active learning methods will be employed to involve students directly in the actual application of this process to simulated practice problems.  Topics: Gastrointestinal Disorders.

        "description": "Globalization is a very popular topic, resulting in a lot of loose and poorly thought-through talk and writing around the subject. The view taken in this course is that to understand current processes of globalization we need to examine it in less broad and amorphous ways by focusing on its specific manifestations. Thus, this course focuses on how China has managed the challenges of globalization. China is a particularly useful case study because it failed the challenges of globalization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For an ancient civilization such as China, this failure had tremendous impact on its national pride. The Chinese refer to this historical juncture as the \"century of shame.\" Towards the end of the 20th century and the onset of the 21st, China faced again the challenges of globalization and has arisen to the tasks in a spectacular fashion, transforming a largely rural and agriculture economy into the world's second largest economic power. This amazing transformation is leading some to proclaim that the 21st century will belong to China! Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

Is it possible to identify distinct neurophysiological markers of your awareness of a particular sight, sound, taste, or touch? What is the cortical basis of your sense of being a self with a first-person point of view that is spatiotemporally grounded in a body? How does consciousness relate to attention and working memory? Does consciousness have an adaptive function? Might a person in a coma or a vegetative state still have some form of awareness? Could a computer or a robot ever have what we would consider to be genuine experiences? During the past few decades, these and other questions about the nature of consciousness have been the focus of increasing empirical and theoretical research in neuroscience and other disciplines. The main purpose of the course is to introduce students to this exciting field of inquiry by exposing them to a variety of representative books and articles in the literature. The \"backbone\" of the course will be Stanisla's Dehaenes Consciousness and the brain: Deciphering how the brain codes our thoughts (2014). As we go through the course, we will use each successive chapter in this book as the starting point for a deeper and wider exploration of the given topic(s), bringing into our discussion relevant experimental findings and philosophical perspectives from other investigators. Requirements: Students will take turns guiding discussions and will also write 1-2 page \"response papers\" to the weekly readings. Permission of department required. Typically offered Fall Spring.",

How does energy flow through farming systems, and how do resources recycle (or not)? What are the weaknesses of farming systems that could be mitigated by mimicking natural systems? Issues of efficiency, sustainability and resilience will be investigated in the context of permaculture, a theory of food production and landscape design that has an emphasis on perennial crops, low input production, and ecological diversity. The centerpiece of the course will be to further develop the Purdue Student Farm using permaculture principles. Typically offered Spring.",

In this course, we will examine the emergence of race and ethnicity as concepts, and how they shape our everyday lives. We will be guided by the following questions: Why do we study race and ethnicity? How and why are they relevant in our society? How do we experience race and ethnicity, and how has this changed over time? Topics include multiculturalism and diversity; media representations; racism and discrimination; colorism; racial hierarchies; immigration; and different domains of racial inequality.

The course exploits the broad expertise of the four faculty members by treating these challenges from diverse disciplinary perspectives, from the biological and physical sciences, to the social sciences, to engineering. By way of a set of case studies, students will analyze the features of these challenges which make them complex, and seek to explain and find solutions to the problems that arise in each case. Their treatment of the cases will be informed by published research and computer simulation. Students will actively participate in discussions regarding these global challenges, and contribute to the progress of the class using oral and written presentations. The course will culminate with a final project completed by teams composed of students from different disciplines. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

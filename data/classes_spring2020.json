We will explore reactions to, and the results of, the spread of American culture both inside and outside the United States. By studying traditional cultural forms like art, music, design, literature, film, and technology the course will build a foundation from which to understand the configuration of American culture. Yet the course will also emphasize American culture expression, that in the forms of television, advertising, sport, cartoons, social media, video games, fashion, food, drugs, and automobiles, have transcended the geographical boundaries of the United States to engage in global interplays of material cultural exchange.

However, recent technoscientific developments have altered this arrangement and have changed the ways sports are played. We have reached a place where heated competitions not only take place on the fields of play, but also within scientific and engineering laboratories. The fundamental question this project-based course will address is: how will new and emerging scientific knowledge and technological innovations transform sports?  We will explore topics ranging from football, baseball, basketball, and soccer, to e-sports, fantasy sports, and sports analytics. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

The emphasis of this first section will be on the general strategies used by viruses to establish and maintain infection in a population.  In the second section, we will discuss in relative detail our current understanding of select important human viruses including influenza, HIV, smallpox, the herpesviruses, and tumor-causing viruses.  The objective of this section will be to understand how the unique aspects of each virus's biology affect the outcome of infection with these pathogens.  In addition to virus-associated diseases, we will discuss potential ways that viruses may provide symbiotic benefits to their hosts and thereby shape the course of human evolution.  Throughout the course, we will emphasize societal and political aspects of virology and virus-derived technologies, including vaccine development, the use of viruses as gene therapy vectors, and the threat of viral bioterror of bio-error.

The course focuses on the principles, tools, and procedures used in the design-build project delivery method. It provides students with sufficient education to become certified (following additional examination) by the Design Build Institute of America as an Associate Member and dependent on employment experience, a full Member. Traditional project delivery methods, Design-Bid-Build, Construction Manager as Agent, `Fast Track', and other `rip and read' methods are losing popularity to project delivery methods that take a more collaborative approach. Collaboration requires a different way of thinking about a capital construction project and working with others in project delivery. Constructors must move from a transactional, arms-length relationship where the project is viewed as a low-price commodity to a full-suite delivery of services resulting in a high-value product. This requires collaboration with the Owner and other members of the project delivery process, something that has been missing from traditional project delivery methods. Active student participation is required. Student participation will be facilitated through assigned presentations, in-class projects, field trips to local projects, and guest lectures. Students who complete the course and achieve DBIA's minimum requirements (Fundamentals of Project Delivery, Principles of Design-Building Project Delivery, Post Award, and Contracts & Risk Management) will be eligible for recognition by DBIA.

This course is designed to cover the essential elements of biochemistry traditionally covered in a two semester series. Topics to be covered include: Amino acids, peptides and proteins, molecular models and structure-function relationships, enzymes, enzyme kinetics and enzyme mechanisms, carbohydrates and carbohydrate metabolism, aerobic metabolism, lipids and membranes, lipid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism and integration and regulation of metabolism. Special emphasis will be placed on connections between biochemical principles and the fields of medicine, human health and disease, nutrition and biotechnology. This course should serve as excellent preparation for higher-level biochemistry courses as well as standardized pre-health professional exams. CHM 33900 was designed as the 4lh semester of the 1-2-1 competency-based curriculum transformation in chemistry as it applies to pre-health professional and life science students at Purdue. However, this course is open to other students who meet the prerequisites.  Typically offered Spring.",

Emphasis is on the unity of the phenomena that underlie the preparation, manipulation, and analysis of ion and electron beams and on the analogies between inelastic reactions of ions and electrons, including those with both gaseous and solid targets. Mass spectrometry is covered in some depth, and a number of newer aspects of particle spectroscopy are treated, including ion scattering spectrometry, Rutherford scattering, energy loss spectrometry (ion and electron), ion kinetic energy spectrometry, ion cyclotron resonance and Auger spectrometry. Applications of these techniques feature structural analysis (compositions of mixtures, molecular structure of organics, electronic state assignment in simple ions), chemical preparations (ion implantation), and isotopic analysis. The underlying chemistry is explored, particularly in considering the kinetics and dynamics of unimolecular fragmentation and in terms of the factors that affect the cross-sections of inelastic collisions.

With an emphasis on automated program verification and synthesis, the course covers classical concepts and techniques such as Hoare logic, abstract interpretation, abstraction-refinement and bounded model checking. The course also exposes students to approaches for program synthesis, a new frontier for program reasoning, such as inductive synthesis, synthesis using version space algebras, constraint-based synthesis and synthesis based on machine-learning techniques. The courses emphasizes both theoretical foundations as well as hands-on experience with verification/synthesis tools and SAT/SMT solvers.   Students are expected to have completed undergraduate coursework in Foundations of Computer Science (CS 18200) or equivalent, Systems Programming (CS 25200) or equivalent, and Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms (CS 38100) or equivalent.

Similarly, it is impossible to understand the impact of law on society without first having an understanding of economic principles. This problem is further complicated by the fact that there are often ambiguities in the written law that lead to significant differences between what the law appears to say and how the law is interpreted in the courts. This course is designed to give the student an understanding of both legal and economic principles and the relationship between them. Finally, through the use of economic analysis, the student will acquire the tools to predict the likely outcomes of particular laws and how they will affect their family and business decisions.

        "description": "This course is designed to provide opportunities for mathematics educators to develop understanding of teaching and learning in the domain of number and operation. Central to this work is the construction of models of learners' understanding of number and operation and the use of those models to build and select curriculum. While curricular efforts have historically taken as central a formal view of mathematics and its construction, more recently curriculum has been written to engage learners and to build from knowledge of learner's understanding. In this course we will develop models of learner's understandings of different facets of number and operation and then use those models and our emerging understanding of curriculum to explore challenges in teaching and learning.

A broad survey of readings guides an in-depth study of fundamental theories of development and knowledge generation as it relates to pedagogy and research. A rich body of theoretical literature will be studied in order to explore its relation to engineering education. Work in the course aims to construct answers to the following three questions: (1) How do theories of human learning, development, and epistemology help us think about engineering? (2) How do they relate to engineering education? (3) How do they inform research method and practice in engineering education? No restrictions. It is helpful, however, for students to have engaged in prior reading-and writing- intensive courses that required them to synthesize large amounts of information. For this reason, it is recommended that students are enrolled currently in a graduate program at Purdue University. Permission of department required. Typically offered Spring.",

Today, toxicology encompasses much broader areas, including the study of endogenous compounds, physical agents, and even using toxicants as research tools. Basic and introductory toxicology courses cover the principles of toxicant metabolism and target organ toxicity. This course, Analytical Toxicology and Toxicologic Pathology is focused on the research and clinical applications of these principles. Two major areas will be covered: (1) principles of toxicant detection in biological matrices and (2) the assessment of pathological effects caused by toxicant exposure in biological systems. Laboratory sessions associated with each major topic allow students to have hands-on experience in these advanced analytical and pathological technologies. This course provides a unique opportunity for students to learn techniques that research and clinical toxicologists use daily in scientific or clinical laboratories. The course is suitable to both graduate and upper-class undergraduate students who are interested in toxicology, forensic science, veterinary medicine, environmental and occupational health, food toxicity, pharmaceutical drug testing, medical laboratory science, and general human and children's health.

To name a few examples of projects we will discuss, SAP's points-based system to encourage carpooling that helps the company save on large gas expenses; at challenge.gov, the Whitehouse encourages innovative solutions through crowdsourcing; and at companies like Google, and Best-Buy, employees participate in information assimilation games called prediction markets providing information to senior managers about ongoing projects. In this course, you will examine the mechanisms behind designing for human instincts and thereby developing an understanding of their effective use in the modern firm. Gamification is one form of design for human instincts. In order for any design to be effective, it should involve clearly defined strategies and well managed execution. To identify effective strategies, and metrics for the application of techniques to business, this course will draw upon interdisciplinary source material as well as real-world case studies. It will also identify a number of significant pitfalls to techniques, as well as notable legal and ethical issues, and the problems with implementing radical change in established firms.

        "description": "People and leaders in organizations are constantly working with members of different backgrounds. This course focuses on talent management of gender and diversity for inclusion from an individual employee, leader and team/organizational perspective. When leveraged effectively diversity has the potential to foster learning, creativity, and innovation, but when ignored or misunderstood these differences in identity and values can lead to increased turnover, conflict, stress, talent under-utilization, and harm career experiences and productivity. This goal of this class is to take a multi-level (individual and organization) to help you learn how to lead the management of diversity and inclusion through a) improving your ability to work in diverse teams, as well as b) developing your ability to lead, develop, and implement strategies to foster cultural and structural change to support improved talent management of gender and diversity toward enhanced organizational effectiveness. Men, as well as women, and majority and minority individuals, will be able to leverage the skills taught in this course when making their own career decisions, as well as when managing, being managed by, or collaborating with others; or leading and changing organizations to support new ways of working. From an individual leadership perspective, we begin by tackling the question: \"Why does diversity matter in employing organizations and business, what is the state of the art evidence-based knowledge, and what does it mean to me personally in my career and my leadership beliefs.\" Specifically, we focus on the business and social science processes- including attitudes toward in-groups and out-groups, stereotyping, identity, privilege, and power, discrimination, bias, equity influence opportunity, bystander awareness, and perspective taking- that affect how members of different social groups perceive and interact with one another. Since managing social identity increasingly involves managing work-life boundaries and work and non-work public and private selves, we will also learn about authenticity choices and social and public/ professional identity boundary management.  From an organizational and group perspective, we address the questions \"What are best practices for successful diversity management?\" We will discuss strategies for creating diversity through HR and management practices; how to create an inclusive culture and positive climate for inclusion and talent management, and developing and retaining diverse talent across multiple levels of intervention (individual, group, intergroup, organizational, and societal). We discuss how to conduct an organizational diagnosis of the current diversity climate and barriers and facilitators for   creating a multicultural workplace and a flexible environment supportive of many identities, and how assumptions may vary across industry and cultural contexts. In addition to readings and learning logs, cases, self- reflections and other exercises, students will have a choice of a teachathon project, which will allow them to somewhat customize the course to their own major interest-managing themselves or managing others. Student engagement and a willingness to share diverse perspectives are critical to the success of this course. To facilitate an active classroom, a range of participative learning methods are used, including learning log reflections, case analysis, experiential exercises, small group discussions, and self-assessments, and research projects. The emphasis is on exploiting diverse ways of learning as well as interaction with real-life examples and situations. The role of the instructor in this course is not to provide \"the\" answer, but to create an environment where you can collectively explore, examine and experiment with your own ideas.",

Specifically, the course is designed to introduce students to the appropriate selection and use of nonprescription medications and devices for the treatment of minor health complaints by patients.  A principle theme throughout the course is that the solution of all self-care problems (i.e., regardless of the context in which they occur) involves the application of the same basic problem solving process.  Course activities, readings and homework assignments will provide students with illustration of how the problem solving process can be applied to specific self-care situations that arise in practice.  Active learning methods will be employed to involve students directly in the actual application of this process to simulated practice problems.  Topics: Gastrointestinal Disorders.

        "description": "This course examines how genes regulate development and function of the brain to ultimately influence behavior. Genetics has come to be an important aspect of research in almost every field of Neuroscience and Psychology ranging from neural development to cognitive function and dysfunction. However, many students have not had the opportunity to explore this in their studies to date. Therefore, the goal of this course is to provide students with the background needed to understand and think critically about the genetic components of Neuroscience and behavioral research. Numerous questions will be explored mainly through discussion of research papers. Lectures by the professor will fill in background knowledge needed to understand the readings. The questions explored will include: What are chromosomes and genes? What do they do? How do they do it? How do genes control development of the brain? How are single genes manipulated in animals to study their effects on behavior? How can genes associated with normal or abnormal behavior be identified? What has been learned from gene-behavior studies in animals? in humans? What do these studies tell us about the nature-nurture controversy? In addition to exploring these more traditional aspects of behavioral genetics we will address the 3 most exciting recent developments. These include the use of transgenic primate models, selective remote control of specific neural circuits using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and epigenetics, which helps explain how environmental factors and behavior itself can change gene activity and how these changes may be transmitted from one generation to the next. Many behaviors could be used to explore the principles these questions address. The readings will be selected from papers that focus on learning & memory and mental illness. However, if students are interested in other behaviors, papers that involve those behaviors and serve our purposes can be substituted. Grading will be based mainly on informal presentations of papers and participation in discussions of these papers. Permission of department required. Typically offered Fall Spring.",

The purpose of this course is to provide a foundation and critical framework for assessing the origins and manifestations of race and ethnicity. Race and ethnicity have historically been one basis for differentiation and stratification in the United States and other societies, and this persists today. In this course, we will examine the emergence of race and ethnicity as concepts, and how they shape our everyday lives. We will be guided by the following questions: Why do we study race and ethnicity? How and why are they relevant in our society? How do we experience race and ethnicity, and how has this changed over time? Topics include multiculturalism and diversity; media representations; racism and discrimination; colorism; racial hierarchies; immigration; and different domains of racial inequality. Typically offered Fall and Spring.",

By way of a set of case studies, students will analyze the features of these challenges which make them complex, and seek to explain and find solutions to the problems that arise in each case. Their treatment of the cases will be informed by published research and computer simulation. Students will actively participate in discussions regarding these global challenges, and contribute to the progress of the class using oral and written presentations. The course will culminate with a final project completed by teams composed of students from different disciplines. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

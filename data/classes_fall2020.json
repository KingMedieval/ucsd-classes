Materials are at the foundation for all of engineering, as evident by the latest products that we design, to the airplanes that we fly, to the latest smart phones. In fact, breakthroughs with material research are often accompanied by rapid advancements in technology. Thus it is paramount for all engineers to have an understanding of the structure and behavior of materials. In this class, we focus on the structure of materials, the microstructure connection to mechanical properties, and ultimately failure mechanisms.  Materials play an important role in both design and manufacturing, which will be addressed in the context of components and extreme environments. Of specific interest will be defects within materials, defect formation/evolution, and their role in strengthening mechanisms. Material anisotropy, micromechanisms, and elasto-plastic properties at the atomic, single-crystal/constituent, and polycrystal-material levels and their use in explaining the deformation and failure characteristics in metals, polymers, and ceramics; failure mechanisms and toughening in composites; structure and behavior of aerospace materials: metal alloys, ceramic-matrix composites, and fiber-reinforced polymer composites. Particular topics will also include: elastic deformation, dislocation mechanics, plastic deformation and strengthening mechanisms, creep, and failure mechanisms; design criteria; special topics. We will attempt to have minimal overlap with AAE 55400, Fatigue of Structures and Materials.  Therefore we will not cover fracture, fatigue, or stress concentrators. Typically offered Fall.",

        "description": "This course examines the evolution of American culture as the United States transitioned from a relatively isolated country at the end of the 19th century to an active shaper of a global community by the 21st century. We will examine ways in which American Culture shaped and was shaped by international relationships that transcend nation states. We will explore reactions to, and the results of, the spread of American culture both inside and outside the United States. By studying traditional cultural forms like art, music, design, literature, film, and technology the course will build a foundation from which to understand the configuration of American culture. Yet the course will also emphasize American culture expression, that in the forms of television, advertising, sport, cartoons, social media, video games, fashion, food, drugs, and automobiles, have transcended the geographical boundaries of the United States to engage in global interplays of material cultural exchange. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

The fundamental question this project-based course will address is: how will new and emerging scientific knowledge and technological innovations transform sports?

We will present a historical perspective of how ideas and data have shaped Cosmology through the centuries. In addition, we will review the theoretical models that are in agreement with the current observations.  Our goal will be to provide the students with a broad overview of the current research in Cosmology with an eye toward stimulating the students curiosity about the many questions still awaiting answers in this field.

A thorough understanding of how game engines work is therefore a requisite element of the game development process and lever for research in most domains involving interactive simulations and games. As game engine development, research, and application is a large and complex topic, the course is split into two semesters of study. The two courses are structured similarly but cover different aspects of development on and within game engines. This course introduces students to the fundamental technologies and skills required to develop video games using a modern game engine. Students are taught using a student-led, active-learning pedagogy in which students co-develop and present lectures, demonstrations, and assignments for their peers, with facilitation by the course instructor. The focus of this course is primarily on the technical, functional, and theoretical dimensions of game development, prioritizing technical soundness over design and creativity (which are covered more explicitly in a separate course). As research in this field continues to rapidly iterate, the latest findings are incorporated into each new offering of the course, refreshing its content as the technology evolves in its implementation and theoretical underpinnings. Production of original research focused upon an aspect of game development or game engine design is required. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

The course analyzes disciplinary differences in approaching the ethical, the human, and environmental problems such as sustainability, development, biodiversity, global security, and climate change. Students will explore what it means to be ethical in and through an interrogation of our contemporary conceptions of what it means to be human. These interrogations in turn will prompt us to reconsider human creations such as knowledge, culture, and technology, which will push us to genuinely think how humans as a species situate their creations within the realm of what they call Nature. Students will be introduced to the history of environmental studies in the discipline, to the rise of what is now known as \"postcolonial ecocriticism\" to theoretical inquiry into modern technology, and to other recent developments in the fields of environmental studies.

Its major goals are to help students understand and appreciate what engineering is, how engineers are trained, what engineers do, and how engineering and society interact. The course approaches these themes through discussion of: the relation and interaction of engineering, science, technology, and society; the historical origins and development of engineering as a profession; diversity issues in engineering and other STEM fields; engineering in cross-national/cultural contexts; and contemporary challenges related to globalization, ethics, and sustainability. In summary, the course is designed to help students understand what it means to identify as, and/or work with, engineers. Recitation sections and/or independent projects (at the instructor's discretion) provide further opportunities for students to expand their knowledge and improve their skills in relation to course themes.

This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD:  reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism.

        "description": "People and leaders in organizations are constantly working with members of different backgrounds. This course focuses on talent management of gender and diversity for inclusion from an individual employee, leader and team/organizational perspective. When leveraged effectively diversity has the potential to foster learning, creativity, and innovation, but when ignored or misunderstood these differences in identity and values can lead to increased turnover, conflict, stress, talent under-utilization, and harm career experiences and productivity. This goal of this class is to take a multi-level (individual and organization) to help you learn how to lead the management of diversity and inclusion through a) improving your ability to work in diverse teams, as well as b) developing your ability to lead, develop, and implement strategies to foster cultural and structural change to support improved talent management of gender and diversity toward enhanced organizational effectiveness. Men, as well as women, and majority and minority individuals, will be able to leverage the skills taught in this course when making their own career decisions, as well as when managing, being managed by, or collaborating with others; or leading and changing organizations to support new ways of working. From an individual leadership perspective, we begin by tackling the question: \"Why does diversity matter in employing organizations and business, what is the state of the art evidence-based knowledge, and what does it mean to me personally in my career and my leadership beliefs.\" Specifically, we focus on the business and social science processes- including attitudes toward in-groups and out-groups, stereotyping, identity, privilege, and power, discrimination, bias, equity influence opportunity, bystander awareness, and perspective taking- that affect how members of different social groups perceive and interact with one another. Since managing social identity increasingly involves managing work-life boundaries and work and non-work public and private selves, we will also learn about authenticity choices and social and public/ professional identity boundary management.  From an organizational and group perspective, we address the questions \"What are best practices for successful diversity management?\" We will discuss strategies for creating diversity through HR and management practices; how to create an inclusive culture and positive climate for inclusion and talent management, and developing and retaining diverse talent across multiple levels of intervention (individual, group, intergroup, organizational, and societal). We discuss how to conduct an organizational diagnosis of the current diversity climate and barriers and facilitators for   creating a multicultural workplace and a flexible environment supportive of many identities, and how assumptions may vary across industry and cultural contexts. In addition to readings and learning logs, cases, self- reflections and other exercises, students will have a choice of a teachathon project, which will allow them to somewhat customize the course to their own major interest-managing themselves or managing others. Student engagement and a willingness to share diverse perspectives are critical to the success of this course. To facilitate an active classroom, a range of participative learning methods are used, including learning log reflections, case analysis, experiential exercises, small group discussions, and self-assessments, and research projects. The emphasis is on exploiting diverse ways of learning as well as interaction with real-life examples and situations. The role of the instructor in this course is not to provide \"the\" answer, but to create an environment where you can collectively explore, examine and experiment with your own ideas.",

Approached from a multi-disciplinary perspective this course brings together gene, brain, and behavioral sciences with the aim of developing a better understanding of autism. The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD:  reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of impact of ASD on the family and society. Typically offered Fall.",

        "description": "(HDFS 41800, PSY 41800) This course will explore the etiology, neuroscience, diagnosis, and treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Approached from a multi-disciplinary perspective this course brings together gene, brain, and behavioral sciences with the aim of developing a better understanding of autism. The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD:  reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of impact of ASD on the family and society. Typically offered Fall.",

In this course, we will examine the emergence of race and ethnicity as concepts, and how they shape our everyday lives. We will be guided by the following questions: Why do we study race and ethnicity? How and why are they relevant in our society? How do we experience race and ethnicity, and how has this changed over time? Topics include multiculturalism and diversity; media representations; racism and discrimination; colorism; racial hierarchies; immigration; and different domains of racial inequality.

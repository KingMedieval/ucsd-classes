Students will manipulate, check and insert data from a variety of sources, use that data as input to distributed hydrologic model, analyze model output and learn methods for properly documenting their data use (creation of metadata) and long-term archival storage of those data. Skills learned should be applicable to most computer operating systems, but the majority of work for this class will be done within the Unix/Linux environment. Students taking this course should have experience with one or more programming languages, including but not limited to C, Fortran, Perl, Python, java, Basic, or two writing scripts or macros within programs such as MatLab, S-Plus, R, SAS.",

This graduate-level course emphasizes charactering demand and supply of agricultural markets and understanding forces that determine commodity and food prices. It also aims to cover a set of economic studies of prices and assist students in applying theoretical frameworks and time-series econometrics to empirical analysis of agricultural prices. In addition to studying prices in perfectly competitive markets, the first half of the course highlights several classic models of consumer demand and agricultural supply, prices under imperfect competition, price spreads (marketing margins), and the economics of information. The second half of the course focuses on empirical price analysis. Popular time-series econometric tools are introduced to study price relationships over space and time, price discovery mechanisms, and functions of futures markets.",

This theoretical angle will be combined with ample opportunities to acquire hands-on experience in the analysis of spatial data. To the effect, up-to-date software, such as GeoDa, R, Stata, and Matlab will be used. A good working knowledge of basic statistics and regression techniques is needed.

It is designed to provide an academic overview of the field of multicultural education as it evolved to this day. The course will offer an introductory overview of the many differences that exist within all human beings. Because the diversity among individuals is endless, we cannot study all differences, but will study a sampling such as race, ethnicity, gender identity, age, social class, disability, learning styles, and religion/spiritual orientation. Issues of poverty, language, and social justice may also be examined in relationship to the above major areas of emphasis.",

We will examine ways in which American Culture shaped and was shaped by international relationships that transcend nation states. We will explore reactions to, and the results of, the spread of American culture both inside and outside the United States. By studying traditional cultural forms like art, music, design, literature, film, and technology the course will build a foundation from which to understand the configuration of American culture. Yet the course will also emphasize American culture expression, that in the forms of television, advertising, sport, cartoons, social media, video games, fashion, food, drugs, and automobiles, have transcended the geographical boundaries of the United States to engage in global interplays of material cultural exchange.",

As a result, controversies arise over issues such as climate change, forest management, genetically modified foods, energy choices, genetic engineering, nanotechnology, water management, and agricultural practices, etc. This course covers the range of issues in the field of science communication including: the nature of science, how to translate evidence for a lay audience, media practices, reporting and qualifying uncertainty, human psychology and belief systems, information processing, and the most current research for messaging science. We will work together to examine the foundational scholarly literature in this area and how it is/ or is not reflected in construction of popular media. You will use this knowledge to construct both compelling oral science narratives, and a science story for popular consumption.",

Emphasis is placed on understanding aviation and aerospace sustainability academic literature and on connecting the global and national policies that lead to the regulations and practices. Aviation sustainability is comprised of multiple areas of impact such as economic, environmental, operational, and social. Students develop an understanding of existing sustainability assessment frameworks such as GRI that have general sustainability assessments along with specialized aviation industry frameworks. Using a multiple attribute analysis approach, students develop metrics and analyze the potential impact of sustainability initiatives in the aviation and aerospace industry. Prerequisites: STAT 30100 or STAT 31100 or STAT 50100 or STAT 51100 or IT 50700 or an instructor-approved statistical foundations course. Proficiency in statistical foundations is required to understand and evaluate environmental, economic and social sustainability data, information and methods presented in this course.",

Prerequisite: Students need to have taken an undergraduate level biochemistry course and be familiar with basic aspects of protein structure that are taught in such courses. In the absence of an undergraduate biochemistry course, students should discuss their qualifications with the instructor before registering.",

The food we put into our bodies not only gives us the nutrients, vitamins and minerals we need to live, but it can also influence other ways in which our bodies function, right down to how well our immune system works. The immune system plays a critical role in defending our body from infection, but can also contribute to autoimmune disease when the immune response becomes dysregulated. Importantly, autoimmune disease is currently skyrocketing in countries that consume a \"Western Diet\" (i.e., high salt, high sugar, low fiber), suggesting that these dietary components, or lack thereof, may contribute to dysregulation of the immune response. CD4+ T cells, a kind of immune cell, play an important role in the immune system as they control the balance between protective immunity and autoimmune disease. Recent evidence indicates a strong correlation between \"Western Diet\" and dysfunction of this important immune cell type. Therefore, our goal is to examine the effects of these dietary components on CD4+ T cell function and how this might contribute to autoimmune disease. Students will work in teams and cover a distinct subset of microbial or dietary components. As such, each student will learn the necessary skills to perform scientific experiments starting from the literature search, experimental design, carrying out controlled experiments, interpreting results and conveying the results to the greater scientific community.",

It will provide a window onto the intersection of science and society and the challenges created when leaders and the populace are inadequately informed. We will explore the biology of the virus and the disease caused by it. The primary literature will be reviewed with the aim of critically evaluating data and understanding the basis of inferences or lack thereof. Vaccine and antiviral approaches will be discussed. Historical approaches to pandemics, comparative analyses of responses by countries and states, investigations into the origins of SARS-CoV-2, and various conspiracy theories will be topics of deliberation.  We will see how achieving scientific understanding is a dynamic process. The COVID-19 scientific literature will be dissected with a focus on publication ethics. Students will each make an oral presentation and write an essay on a relevant topic thereby allowing them to fulfill graduation requirements. These assignments will require the demonstration of the capacity to report data, organize the material, and convey it using formal English. All sources will need to be documented and assessed for credibility. The initial tranche of classes will be lectures by the Professor with discussion. Most of the remaining classes will be student presentations on assigned topics with moderation by the Professor. Guest lectures by appropriate experts will also be included.",

        "description": "The objective of this course is to provide students with an introductory understanding of viruses and their impact on human health. The course will be divided into two sections. During the first section, we will discuss the cellular and organismal events that occur following virus infection, including viral entry, replication, modulation of cell biology by viral proteins, the host immune response to infection, evasion of the immune response by viruses, and resulting virus-induced disease. The emphasis of this first section will be on the general strategies used by viruses to establish and maintain infection in a population. In the second section, we will discuss in relative detail our current understanding of select important human viruses including influenza, HIV, smallpox, the herpesviruses, and tumor-causing viruses. The objective of this section will be to understand how the unique aspects of each virus's biology affect the outcome of infection with these pathogens. In addition to virus-associated diseases, we will discuss potential ways that viruses may provide symbiotic benefits to their hosts and thereby shape the course of human evolution.  Throughout the course, we will emphasize societal and political aspects of virology and virus-derived technologies, including vaccine development, the use of viruses as gene therapy vectors, and the threat of viral bioterror of bio-error.",

The course is divided into five 3-week modules covering (i) Crystallization, (ii) Data Collection, (iii) Molecular Replacement, (iv) Experimental Phasing, and (v) Model Building and Refinement, Validation, and Visualization. The goal of the course is to equip students with the necessary tools to develop and execute an X-ray crystallography project, starting from construct design to publication. By the end of the course, students should be familiar with the (i) structure determination pipeline, (ii) theory behind X-ray diffraction methods, (iii) methods for crystallization, (iv) phasing options for solving a crystal structure, and (v) contemporary crystallography software.",

Using the skills learned the previous semester, each student is required to make a 20-minute PowerPoint presentation to the class, based on a pre-approved topic of their choice. The speaker is asked questions and the presentation receives written evaluations by all members of the class. Each student practices with the course instructor prior to the public presentation. The course also continues to socialize the incoming cohort of students among themselves and with more senior students in the broad range of research disciplines available.",

The course can be loosely classified into two parts: (i) guiding principles and fundamental equations for thermodynamics in biological and biomedical engineering, and (ii) applications of engineering principles to the study of biological systems.",

We will also explore advanced concepts like transient responses, AC impedance, and the dynamic behavior of first and second-order systems. Students will gain proficiency in phasor analysis of sinusoidal signals, complex number calculations, signal sampling, and spectral analysis. We'll also touch on linear time-invariant systems, frequency response, and both the design and implementation of filters. A portion of the course will focus on control systems via the s-domain. To enrich your understanding and skill set, we will also introduce programming through Python, which will facilitate data processing and deepen your conceptual grasp. This course serves as a preparatory steppingstone for BME 33000 (Bioelectricity), equipping you with the essential physics knowledge and skills required for more advanced studies.",

Many plant pathogens and diseases have increased their geographic distribution and intensity in the U.S. and the world. A lack of epidemiological understanding can exacerbate problems and significantly challenge the management of diseases at the field level. This course is an introduction to the epidemiological basis of disease management strategies. The course includes concepts in botanical epidemiology, disease assessment and measurement, disease modeling, epidemics comparison, and a revision of the traditional plant disease control principles. Plant Disease Epidemiology is an upper-level course for students interested in plant pathology, agronomy, data-driven Ag, national or international agriculture, or closely related areas. Although some pathosystems are used as model systems, Plant Disease Epidemiology is not a \"how-to\" course on controlling specific plant diseases.",

It focuses on creating innovative and intuitive visualization solutions to provide users with peripheral awareness of meaningful information from a complex data set. Employing a user-centric approach, this course studies and analyzes visualization design and development from data, tasks, and visualization and interactions. The students will learn perception theories on visualization and use visual elements such as space and color to encode data, compare, evaluate, choose among different visualization forms and interaction methods. Through a project-based learning approach, students will conduct case studies on various visualization designs, analyze the user, data, tasks, and design choices in the visualizations, and finally design and develop information visualization solutions as course projects. Students should have finished their undergraduate study in domains that are closely related to one or more of the following: business analysis, statistics, knowledge management, computer science, software engineering, interaction design, human-centered computing, scientific visualization or information visualization.

Emphasis is on the unity of the phenomena that underlie the preparation, manipulation, and analysis of ion and electron beams and on the analogies between inelastic reactions of ions and electrons, including those with both gaseous and solid targets. Mass spectrometry is covered in some depth, and a number of newer aspects of particle spectroscopy are treated, including ion scattering spectrometry, Rutherford scattering, energy loss spectrometry (ion and electron), ion kinetic energy spectrometry, ion cyclotron resonance and Auger spectrometry. Applications of these techniques feature structural analysis (compositions of mixtures, molecular structure of organics, electronic state assignment in simple ions), chemical preparations (ion implantation), and isotopic analysis. The underlying chemistry is explored, particularly in considering the kinetics and dynamics of unimolecular fragmentation and in terms of the factors that affect the cross-sections of inelastic collisions.

The course material is essential for research in theoretical computer science as well as machine learning theory. The course is targeted at students who plan to pursue research in these areas. Topics will be chosen from four core areas: Convex Analysis and Optimization, Spectral Methods, Concentration Inequalities, and Discrete Fourier Analysis. Depending on student and instructor interest, additional topics will be chosen and may include applied analysis, coding theory, probabilistic proofs, and more advanced topics in discrete Fourier analysis. Students will read papers in theoretical computer science and machine learning theory using, exploring and extending the covered techniques and tools. Students are expected to be proficient in probability theory, have the maturity to follow and carry out basic analysis proofs, and have completed courses in calculus, linear algebra, discrete mathematics, and analysis of algorithms. More specifically, the course expects mastery of the material covered in Calculus III, Linear Algebra, Probability, Foundations of CS, and Analysis of Algorithms.",

Students will learn the technical aspects of creating a professional performance by both observing performance production and developing an actual performance, which this semester is the Xperimental 2024 Concert. Students may participate in the production in a variety of active roles; however, they will be exposed to all aspects through observation, participation, and discussion. Production roles include: director and assistant director, choreographer, performer, lighting design and staging, sound design and technical support, and stage crew (stage manager, house manager, ticket manager, setup and strike support). Occasional class sessions cover skills to enhance your knowledge of some areas of production such as sound design, and lighting technology. For many students who are at the university level, the art of performance is defined almost totally by the act of being on stage performing, in studios or on stages. This course is designed to invite students to learn about all the activities that are done behind the scenes in order for live performances to be presented to an audience. We will discuss what is involved in both large institutional performance spaces, and compare this to our university performance. Then we will discuss what this scenario looks like for performance professionals after college. This course will greatly enhance students' ability to produce their own events in the future, and develop greater appreciation for the collaborative nature of live performance as art form.",

This course examines the role of the arts and the artist and their relationship to activism throughout history and beyond. We will investigate how art has been used as a tool to transform cultural perspectives, alter policies, and promote social change. We will explore a range of artists whose methodologies, materials and approach challenge the cultural norms. From printmakers to musicians, to choreographers, to performance artists, students will engage and evaluate the act of art-making as a tactic of resistance and the responses to those acts. We will investigate readings that argue for and against the need for artists to make work that politically challenge their society. Once a foundation of knowledge has been laid, we will turn to the creative process through an investigation of materials and practices - performance, mixed media, and photography. Students will research, watch, discuss, create, and perform their own projects that promote social transformation.",

While the specific details of such networks will depend on the application, the last few decades have seen the emergence of an underlying \"science'' of networks, comprised of a common language (graph theory) for representing large-scale networks, along with mathematical models and analytical techniques for studying structure and dynamics. This course will provide a detailed introduction to the field of network science. It will develop common mathematical representations of networks, metrics for identifying important features of networks, generative mechanisms for networks (including both random-graph and strategic network formation perspectives), and tools for studying dynamical processes on networks (such as information cascades, opinion dynamics and interconnected dynamical systems). This is an introductory course that establishes several of the fundamental tools and concepts in network science, and requires only an undergraduate background in probability and linear algebra.",

Topics include the organization, analysis, and interpretation of data; descriptive statistics; probability theory; sampling distributions; inference and hypothesis testing; and simple linear regression analysis. The approach of the class includes both learning the concepts behind basic statistics and also how to apply these concepts to make data-informed, real-world economic decisions. Students will become familiar with the common statistical techniques and databases for analyzing data by using both hand-calculations and STATA to analyze data.",

Critical cross-cultural science education is defined as the process of actively engaging students in collaborative inquiry about what science is; whose interests are served by science; who decides what science is and what gets funded as science; and what kinds of individual and collective roles individuals could play as informed and responsible citizens in supporting the advancement of science to benefit society.

Central to this work is the construction of models of learners' understandings of geometry and measurement and the use of models to design instruction. Geometry, as a discipline in school mathematics, has historically and more currently been debated. In this course we will explore research in the teaching and learning of geometry and measurement. A synthesis of select literature will inform our efforts to develop models of learners' geometric reasoning and understanding of measurement. We will move past the development of models to the design of instruction meant to support understandings of concepts that utilizes technology.",

        "description": "This course provides a solid foundation and set of principles for differentiating curriculum and instruction in any classroom at any grade level. Students will explore a variety of evidence-based strategies, tools, and curriculum models that effectively meet the diverse needs of all learners. Through readings, online classroom meetings and discussions, case studies, differentiated instruction examples, direct application and reflection, students will deepen their understanding and need to differentiate. With an overarching goal of increasing achievement and developing student talents, this course includes the following major components: creating positive learning environments that support a) high-quality curriculum; b) diagnostic, formative and summative assessments to inform instructional decision-making; and c) flexible grouping addressing student differences in readiness, interest, and learning profile (including learning preference, intelligence preference, gender, culture, language preference, locale, and opportunities to learn) and appreciating how these differences influence the ways in which students learn. Understanding that process of differentiation involves modifying content, process, product, learning environment, and/or affect incorporating higher-order thinking skills, creative problem solving, project-based learning, authentic/respectful tasks, collaborative learning, and other evidence-based strategies to promote student achievement and talent development understanding how differentiation of curriculum and instruction fits within specific educational interventions and models, such as scaffolding, flexible grouping, Response to Intervention (Rtl), and Multi-Tiered System of Support(MTSS). Effective teachers do more than teach content; they teach unique individuals who enter classrooms with various levels of expertise, skills, abilities, social-emotional needs, and learning expectations. Effective teachers differentiate curriculum by personalizing content based on the particular needs and interests of their students. Effective teachers differentiate instruction by applying various grouping strategies, technology applications and thinking skills. The goal of every effective teacher is that every child learns something new every day. Cannot be taken concurrently with EDPS 24000.",

This course is intended to be taken early in a graduate student's curriculum and therefore is designed to be a bridge between the student's previous experience with engineering (education, work, and teaching) and new engineering education research-based approaches.  It is intended as an entryway to help students apply an engineering design approach to the design of instruction.  To meet this aim, the course involves an iterative project-based approach in a context (design site) that is chosen by the student for its relevance, interest and potential application.",

Through multiple experiences, students will learn effective methods to design and analyze behaviors of complex engineering systems with an eye for innovation. These experiences will develop their skills in teaming, project management, logical reasoning, sustainability, coupled with oral, written and visual communication for multiple audiences. This course also develops students ability to build computational tools (e.g., Python, MATLAB and Excel) to analyze the performance of systems using fundamental concepts associated with physical science and data science (e.g., mathematical modeling, data processing, numerical modeling, statistics). Professional identify development is critical to preparing students for making an informed decision in their choice of major and the development of professional skills to succeed in that major. Therefore, the course includes learning experiences to help them gather and process information about all the engineering academic pathways they could choose at Purdue.

The students continue to explore more complicated models of physical systems, especially internal energy, entropy, models of gases and fluids, and statistical thermodynamics. The students will extend the concepts learned in ENGR 16100 and continue to develop skills in project management, engineering fundamentals, oral and graphical communication, logical thinking, teamwork, and modern engineering tools (e.g., Matlab, and Python). In addition, students will learn how to use hypothesis testing to make informed, quantitative decisions. Finally, they will build systems that incorporate feedback control in an effort to identify and characterize physical material systems.",

Projects of at least one year in duration are intended to solve real problems that are defined in consultation with customers from not-for-profit community and educational organizations. EPCS courses are open to students from all disciplines; each student contributes expertise in his/her academic discipline. Each team consists of a mix of first-year, sophomores, juniors, and seniors.  Students are encouraged to participate in an EPICS project for two or more semesters. First-year students participating in EPICS gain insight into the specific project, and more generally, into the design and development process. Under mentorship from upper-level students and instructors, they perform and report upon design tasks consistent with their level of discipline expertise.",

The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associated with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of impact of ASD on the family and society.",

Historically, the attempts to automate human cognitive functions - from the mere reckoning of numbers to complex decision-making have been entangled with heated debates about what counts as good, proper, and desirable thinking; whose thinking machines should emulate; and whether the thinking of some humans is inferior to that of machines. In this course, we will examine how the invention of calculating machines - analogue and then digital - has developed in tandem with philosophical and scientific theories of human thinking and intelligence. In their turn, the latter developed as a response to changing social, political, and economic currents.",

And we will investigate the ways in which this artists' talk became the \"talk of the town\" and country as a medium through which people could break from dominant cultures.

With an emphasis on historical accounts of poisonings and case analyses, the course describes commonly encountered chemicals and poisons, their symptoms, clinical diagnosis, basic toxicological mechanisms, and medical interventions. Students will also learn some of the large-scale environmental and occupational incidents that have led to legal actions, and the role of toxicology in forensic investigation of purposed poisoning. The course is ideal to students who are inspired to become a future healthcare professional in any of the health-oriented pre-professional programs or students with majors in biomedical health sciences, environmental and occupational health sciences, medical laboratory science, and/or public health.",

We will engage theoretical texts on mapping and social justice to identify how GIS and maps can expose and resist oppression and inequality. Students will apply critical theory through the practice of critical cartography to analyze a course-related topic of their choosing and use GIS tools to create an original project. Students will move away from the traditional research paper and engage with a digital research platform that enhances research impact and scholarship reach while applying such tools to interrogate the power dynamics contained within them. It provides the opportunity to serve as a tool for community collaborations in social activism as a shareable document.

        "description": "Students will learn the concepts of how to approach research in the area of Energetic Materials (EM) based on an understanding of the fundamental principles. Students will learn how energetic materials are fabricated, safety used, as well as understand life cycle issues, homogeneous & heterogenous combustion, and advanced energetic material concepts. Multiphase combustion phenomena will be introduced and emphasized. They will apply these concepts to a literature review and group research project, as well as that includes applying thermochemistry and chemical kinetic software. In addition, six hands-on labs are performed. This material will be covered in the context of real-world applications, with an emphasis on energetic materials, combustion, propulsion, explosives, pyrotechnics, and detonation phenomenon. Pre-requisite: ME 52500 or AAE 53900 or consent of instructor.",

The course aims to provide a working knowledge of the vocabulary of OM, to help students develop an ability to design, improve, and manage processes by answering the questions: What are the components of a process? How should various process parameters such as capacities, output, and work-in-process inventories be calculated? What are the major opportunities for improving a process? The students get familiar with key issues (cost, quality, delivery, and flexibility) and problems (e.g., variability) facing an operations manager. At the end of the course, the students analyze operational strengths and weaknesses of a local firm, suggest some improvements of its operations and present the results.",

The main tool of analysis of the course is stochastic calculus set in continuous time. Some basic knowledge of stochastic processes would be helpful, but not essential: what needed will be covered in class. The analytic valuation and hedging of derivatives using the modern martingale methods will be the main focus of the course. Applications will include forwards, futures, and options on stocks, bonds and foreign currencies. The numerical methods such as parameter estimation, Monte Carlo simulations, discretization schemes as well as the conditional volatility estimation techniques will also be addressed. In addition to the valuation and hedging derivatives, course also covers Value-at-Risk, credit risk, modeling the term structure of interest rates and the construction of the VIX index using the S&P 500 index options obtained from the IvyDB OptionMetric database.",

There are no traditional classes. Rather, students will work in self-managed teams of 5-6 on projects that have both business and engineering elements with the support of a mentor; in many cases the mentor will be from a sponsoring company. The role of the company mentor is to provide advice and guidance to the student team as well as to expose the students to the approaches and processes used in industrial and commercial organizations. The course instructors will also meet with the student teams on a weekly basis to assess progress and provide guidance. Possible options for the projects include: \"Product Design\" and \"Business Solution\". The Product Design projects would be focused on the marketing, technical, and economic feasibility of a new product concept. The Business Solution projects would be focused on technical issues in a business context and developing solutions to a \"real world\" problem presented by a sponsoring company. Examples of these projects might include use of 3-D printing for spare and replacement parts or incorporation of autonomous transportation into a company's operations and supply chain.",

CRM requires a shift in mindset from product-centric to customer-centric management and a new set of tools for understanding and predicting the behavior of current customers. This course focuses on analytical CRM: identifying good prospects and customer acquisition, customer development via up-selling, cross-selling and personalization, customer attrition, retention, and customer lifetime value. While traditional marketing relied on the three pillars of segmentation, targeting and positioning (STP), technological advances have made it possible to obtain customer-level transaction data, and also to target individual customers with a customized marketing mix that is designed to maximize individual customer value. Important strategic questions arise from such a radical shift in marketing mix options, questions such as: How to allocate resources to customer acquisition and to customer retention? Are loyal customers more profitable for firms? Related to these strategic questions are important conceptual and computational issues, such as: What metrics are best used to measure customer profitability? What techniques can be used to identify most profitable customers? How to target profitable customers with customized price, promotion, product, place? This course will equip you with the skills and tools you need to answer such strategic, conceptual and computational questions related to customer relationship management (CRM).

We will draw on research from psychology, marketing, behavior economics and other fields to learn why consumers behave in the ways that they do. The course focuses on three general topics: 1) Consumers as individuals. We will explore basic psychological concepts like intrinsic motivation, perception, memory, and emotions to help us understand behavior. 2) Attitude change and decision making. We will examine how consumers search and evaluate alternatives, develop attitudes, and make choices. 3) Consumers in their social and cultural settings. We will examine the interaction between the consumer and multiple external influences. We investigate how social elements (friends, family, etc.) and culture influence behavior. Consumer behavior is an applied discipline rooted in other social sciences, and you will therefore learn multiple concepts, frameworks and theories. Your job is to master those concepts and use them to organize, explain, and predict consumers' judgments and choices. Ultimately you should be able to identify a consumer behavior issue, select a relevant theory to examine and explain the issue, and apply the theory properly to aid in a managerial decision. You will also learn how to run basic applied experiments in consumer behavior to test your theories with real consumers.",

Students learn about projects, roles and responsibilities of project managers. We start by discussing the skills and approaches commonly used in creating and monitoring project plans and braking complex projects down into manageable segments. We also discuss important areas defined in PMI's PMBOK, like scope, time, cost and quality management. Next we look at how IT projects have traditionally been managed, and move on to the study of agile methods. We go through some of the most important aspects of agile project management, such as user stories, agile teams an agile planning, execution and tracking. In learning these tools and techniques, we take a hands-on approach wherever possible and use project management software, exercises and case studies.",

        "description": "In today's business environment, it is increasingly apparent that business success is driven by a firm's ability to create and capture value through technology and innovation. Thus, the processes used by firms to develop new technologies, the choices they make regarding how to commercialize their technical knowledge, and the strategies they used to position and build a dominate competitive position all are important issues facing the firm. This course seeks to develop tools for understanding industry evolution with respect to new technology, forecast technological change, and understand the basis for technology in competitive advantage. We take an in-depth look at how technological innovation affects the competitive dynamics of markets, how firms can strategically manage these dynamics, and how firms can create and implement strategies to maximize their likelihood of success. The course introduces tools, concepts, and analytical frameworks that will enhance your ability to define and analyze strategic problems that stem from innovation and technological change, and to identify sources of competitive advantage from both an industry and firm-level perspective.

The format for this course is based on three components: reading and reflection, along with in-class discussion; in-class guest speakers who will address various topics in philosophy as a field, and/or professionalization (both within and outside of academia); and short written exercises, often done in class, which are designed to build up to the final project. Most classes will begin with a guest speaker giving a brief introduction to a particular area or topic within philosophy. Students will have a short reading assigned for each class period that will be discussed with the instructor following the guest's presentation. The course readings will be, as best as possible, related to the area/topic introduced by the guest. Certain classes will be dedicated solely to career/professionalization interests and will feature guests with expertise in these areas. The professionalization experts will help students develop their career goals, identify possible internships and scholarships to pursue while a student at Purdue, and develop career goals for after they have graduated. Finally, certain classes will be dedicated to writing and the development of the final project, which will include a proposed 8-semester path of study, a polished resume/CV, and career/professionalization goals.",

We will focus on seven major philosophers (and their followers): Kongzi (Confucius), Mozi, Mengzi (Mencius), Zhuangzi, Laozi, Xunzi, and Han Feizi. We will use their work to consider topics such as: the nature and value of morality, the proper role of ritual in human life, whether human nature is good or bad, how one becomes a moral person, the proper role and function of government, and more. In addition to introducing the competing traditions of Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, and Legalism, the course will help students to develop basic philosophical skills as they develop and defend their own views on these topics. No knowledge of Chinese is expected.",

The course will be focused on learning physical science by doing science i.e. developing understanding by collaborative activities and discussion in the laboratory and lecture and communicating your ideas to others. The course will have one 50-minute lecture and two 110-minute laboratory meetings each week. The course content is consistent with the CAEP (Council for the Accreditation of Education Preparation) K-6 Elementary Teacher Preparation Standards (Standard 2: Understanding and Applying Content and Curricular  Knowledge for Teaching in Physical Science and Engineering Design) and the NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards) Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs) for the Physical Sciences (Physical Sciences PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4) as well as many of the Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs). The course will be divided into four units: 1) Matter and Interactions 2) Motion and Stability 3) Energy and 4) Waves and their applications. All of these units will be delivered through the paradigm of solving engineering design problems. Engineering design involves many different practices: problem definition, model development and use, investigation, analysis and interpretation of data, application of mathematics and computational thinking, and determination of solutions.",

Starting with the concepts of quantum superposition, it defines and describes qubits (quantum bits) and their manipulation by quantum logic gates. The topics of quantum entanglement and the EPR paradox are introduced, and their importance for quantum teleportation, communication, and quantum cryptography are covered. Quantum computing is described in terms of quantum circuits of logic gates, and also in terms of quantum algorithms, such as Deutsch's algorithm, the quantum Fourier transform, Shor's prime factoring algorithm, and Grover's search algorithm. The final topic is quantum decoherence and the limits it places on practical implementations of quantum computing.",

We will begin with issues of definition, and theoretical and empirical approaches to the study of terrorism. We will then delve into the history and evolution of the tactic (taking time to study some of the more notorious organizations). At this point in time it is critical that we look at both domestic--particularly in the United States--and transnational forms of terrorism. The study of terrorism is rife with puzzles that we will explore. Why resort to violence in the first place? How and why do groups evolve over time? How and why do some groups end, and others continue for years? Why are some individuals/groups not classified as terrorists? What are the consequences of terrorism? We will also look closely at counterterrorism policy. What are the most effective ways to respond to terrorism? What doesn't work? How do policies differ between states? To what extent is there global cooperation on counterterrorism? We will conclude the class by taking a critical look at US counterterrorism policy and the massive counterterrorism apparatus that has developed in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001. Should counterterrorism dominate US national security priorities to the degree it does?",

The view taken in this course is that to understand current processes of globalization we need to examine it in less broad and amorphous ways by focusing on its specific manifestations. Thus, this course focuses on how China has managed the challenges of globalization. China is a particularly useful case study because it failed the challenges of globalization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For an ancient civilization such as China, this failure had tremendous impact on its national pride. The Chinese refer to this historical juncture as the \"century of shame.\" Towards the end of the 20th century and the onset of the 21st, China faced again the challenges of globalization and has arisen to the tasks in a spectacular fashion, transforming a largely rural and agriculture economy into the world's second largest economic power. This amazing transformation is leading some to proclaim that the 21st century will belong to China!",

The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history of ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associated with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of impact of ASD on the family and society.",

Is it possible to identify distinct neurophysiological markers of your awareness of a particular sight, sound, taste, or touch? What is the cortical basis of your sense of being a self with a first-person point of view that is spatiotemporally grounded in a body? How does consciousness relate to attention and working memory? Does consciousness have an adaptive function? Might a person in a coma or a vegetative state still have some form of awareness? Could a computer or a robot ever have what we would consider to be genuine experiences? During the past few decades, these and other questions about the nature of consciousness have been the focus of increasing empirical and theoretical research in neuroscience and other disciplines. The main purpose of the course is to introduce students to this exciting field of inquiry by exposing them to a variety of representative books and articles in the literature. The \"backbone\" of the course will be Stanisla's Dehaenes Consciousness and the brain: Deciphering how the brain codes our thoughts (2014). As we go through the course, we will use each successive chapter in this book as the starting point for a deeper and wider exploration of the given topic(s), bringing into our discussion relevant experimental findings and philosophical perspectives from other investigators. Requirements: Students will take turns guiding discussions and will also write 1-2 page \"response papers\" to the weekly readings. Permission of department required.",

The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of impact of ASD on the family and society.",

Assessment and evidence-based intervention for people who cannot meet their daily communication needs via natural speech and/or writing and who need AAC will be covered. AAC is neither disorder- nor age-specific. As such, AAC strategies, techniques, and options may be used across the lifespan and with people who have severe communication disorders that interfere with expressive and/or receptive speech and/or language. In that way, AAC can have broad applicability across settings and populations.",

It is essential that audiologists have a firm understanding of the most common causes and medical treatments of hearing impairment for all age groups. Additionally, the future clinician will be better served by recognizing how rapidly information changes in this arena and becoming comfortable with reliable educational resources that are available for life-long learning in this area. Audiologists also practice in a medical setting and thus must be comfortable with the medical approaches and terminology used by otolaryngologists, otologists, neuro-otologists, pediatricians, radiologists, anesthesiologists and other physicians. Additionally, audiologists may be the first contact with a hearing-impaired patient and their role in the referral process will be emphasized.",

Multiple systems concepts and methods have been developed to address these situations, and typical courses in systems focus on a relatively small portion of the rich assortment of available approaches to addressing systems problems. This course introduces students to multiple systems concepts and methods via readings and class lecture. The students then apply these concepts and methods on team-based projects. The course will emphasize critical thinking about how the concepts and methods are applicable to the problematic situations of the projects and how well the project teams were able to perform the required activities.",

This unique course brings together perspectives from technology and anthropology to address this by exploring ethnographic studies of people and technology interactions. Through this process, students will practice the problem scoping skills necessary to identify and define problems and begin to generate appropriate design solutions. In addition, students will learn how to observe and talk with people about technology and discuss a range of ways people use technology. Accordingly, the course will focus on human-centered design and how to empathize with people during the design process. This will allow students to learn how to identify opportunities for innovation that emerge when designers carefully observe and listen to humans using technology and/or experiencing problems with current technology. Note: This class engages the material in both the classroom and innovation labs.",

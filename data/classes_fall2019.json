We will explore reactions to, and the results of, the spread of American culture both inside and outside the United States. By studying traditional cultural forms like art, music, design, literature, film, and technology the course will build a foundation from which to understand the configuration of American culture. Yet the course will also emphasize American culture expression, that in the forms of television, advertising, sport, cartoons, social media, video games, fashion, food, drugs, and automobiles, have transcended the geographical boundaries of the United States to engage in global interplays of material cultural exchange.

This progress is the result of improved observational techniques that have resulted in high resolution images of very distant galaxies, a more accurate mapping of the Large Scale Structure of the Universe or the high resolution picture of the young universe provided by Cosmic Microwave Background observations. We will present a historical perspective of how ideas and data have shaped Cosmology through the centuries. In addition, we will review the theoretical models that are in agreement with the current observations.  Our goal will be to provide the students with a broad overview of the current research in Cosmology with an eye toward stimulating the students curiosity about the many questions still awaiting answers in this field.

Almost everyone has heard of the human genome project, but fewer are aware of the spectacular technical progress in this field and the fact that many thousands of genomes have been sequenced.  Until recently, most of these have been microorganisms, but technological and computational progress has made it progressively easier and cheaper to sequence the genomes of higher organisms.  This field may have more of an impact on your future lives than almost any other field of the life sciences -  mostly because it touches on all areas of study.  The course will focus on the impact that genomes will have in selected areas.  It will begin with a basic understanding of the science and technology that gave rise to our current capabilities in sequencing and the fact that technology continues to provide greater capacity and cheaper prices.  You will soon see that every field in the College of  Science is well represented in the science and technology.  We will then go on to see how genomics influences many topics that affect our daily lives and can possibly provide answers to some critical questions (or at least pose better questions):  What is the basis of personalized medicine?  What does genomics tell us about the genealogy of mankind?  What impact will genomics have on our future food supply and our ability to feed a population of 9 billion people? What is the human microbiome and what does that mean to me?  Similarly, what is the gut microbiome, the mouthmicrobiome, etc? What impact will genomics have on the development of alternative energy sources, especially biofuels? In every area, we will discuss the scientific challenges, but also the ethical and societal implications.  In most cases, there is no one right answer, but a series of choices that can be guided by ethical considerations.  Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

Topics will include understanding the evolutionary organization of genes (genomics), the structure and function of gene products (proteomics), and the dynamics of gene expression in biological processes (transcriptomics). Inherently, bioinformatics is interdisciplinary, melding various applications of computational science with biology. This jointly taught course introduces analytical methods from biology, statistics and computer science that are necessary for bioinformatics investigations. The course is intended for junior and senior undergraduates from various science backgrounds. Our objective is to develop the skills of both tool users and tool designers in this important new field of research.",

The first part covers basic concepts, terminology, procedures and computations of control systems including block diagrams & transfer functions, open-loop & closed-loop control, control system modeling, time response, root locus techniques, design via root locus, and digital control systems. The second part focuses on issues surrounding the building controls: interfacing components such as sensors and actuators, problems encountered, and state-of-the-art solutions for building energy efficiency and thermal comfort. The third part aims to develop students' ability to convert control system concepts into real building control systems. The course provides a hands-on opportunity for students to complete three projects associated with the three primary components during the semester: indoor environmental quality assessment, building HVAC system commissioning and its control analysis, and new control algorithm development for building energy efficiency, occupant health, and individual productivity.

Inherently, bioinformatics is interdisciplinary, melding various applications of computational science with biology. This jointly taught course introduces analytical methods from biology, statistics and computer science that are necessary for bioinformatics investigations. The course is intended for junior and senior undergraduates from various science backgrounds. Our objective is to develop the skills of both tool users and tool designers in this important new field of research.",

Interestingly the same amazing technology has also led to a deeper understanding of the nature of current flow on an atomic scale. The aim of this course is to make the fundamentals of nanoelectronics accessible to anyone in any branch of science or engineering, assuming very little background beyond linear algebra and differential equations, although we will be discussing advanced concepts in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that should be of interest even to specialists. We first introduce a new perspective connecting the quantized conductance of short ballistic conductors to the familiar Ohm's  law of long diffusive conductors, along with a brief description of the modern nano-transistor. We then address fundamental conceptual issues related to the meaning of resistance on an atomic scale, the interconversion of electricity and heat, the second law of thermodynamics and the fuel value of information. Finally we introduce the concepts of quantum transport as applied to modern nanoscale electronic devices. Typically offered Fall.",

Its major goals are to help students understand and appreciate what engineering is, how engineers are trained, what engineers do, and how engineering and society interact. The course approaches these themes through discussion of: the relation and interaction of engineering, science, technology, and society; the historical origins and development of engineering as a profession; diversity issues in engineering and other STEM fields; engineering in cross-national/cultural contexts; and contemporary challenges related to globalization, ethics, and sustainability. In summary, the course is designed to help students understand what it means to identify as, and/or work with, engineers. Recitation sections and/or independent projects (at the instructor's discretion) provide further opportunities for students to expand their knowledge and improve their skills in relation to course themes.

        "description": "Together, Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) courses create a vertical project track under which students work in multidisciplinary teams on long-term engineering-based design projects.  Projects of at least one year in duration are intended to solve real problems that are defined in consultation with customers from not-for-profit community and educational organizations.  EPCS courses are open to students from all disciplines; each student contributes expertise in his/her academic discipline.  Each team consists of a mix of first-year, sophomores, juniors, and seniors.  Students are encouraged to participate in an EPICS project for two or more semesters.  First-year students participating in EPICS gain insight into the specific project, and more generally, into the design and development process.  Under mentorship from upper-level students and instructors, they perform and report upon design tasks consistent with their level of discipline expertise.  Typically offered Fall Spring.",

The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD:  reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of impact of ASD on the family and society. Typically offered Fall.",

Topics include decreased balance control, loss of muscle strength, and declines in adaptive locomotion as a function of age. Students enrolled in this class also participate in an off-campus lab. In the lab, students are paired with an older adult and use the knowledge gained in lecture to improve the motor function of the older adult. This class provides students with a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience working with an older population. Permission of instructor required. Typically offered Fall Spring.",

A non-Indoeuropean lesser-studied language will be examined with the help of a native speaker of the language.  The main area of its grammar will be covered: phonetic and phonological system, inflectional and derivational morphology, basic syntactic structures and basic semantic phenomena.  The final goal is to obtain a basic grammatical description of the language.  Lab sessions will be directed towards the training in the software and audio and video tools used for the trade.

We question the assumptions behind the concept of \"Managing Human Capital,\" because HR managers are first and foremost business people. The key to business success is to read broadly and to understand how culture, economics, history, and politics converge. Through frequent writing assignments, close readings of personal accounts, and daily class discussions, students will gain insights into how culture, economics, history, and politics intersect to influence human behavior and worldviews. Case studies and examples will be drawn from the United States, China, and Taiwan. Finally, we will apply what we have learned to the practice of global cultural dexterity. Students will identify cultural nuances and subtleties in order to share examples of how each student has adapted or failed to adapt to different cultural dynamics. Typically offered Fall.",

Each learning goal was expanded to finer-grained target ideas creating more steps to make concepts more understandable and explicit.  Activities were designed to enable students to develop deep conceptual understanding of each target area and the structure and sequence were guided by research on student learning.  In this class social interactions are used to clarify ideas and to encourage peer teaching.  The students' understandings are based on prior knowledge.  The class is based on a constructivist framework where new understandings are scaffolded from partial to incomplete understandings, and those are refined over time. Typically offered Fall Spring.",

The view taken in this course is that to understand current processes of globalization we need to examine it in less broad and amorphous ways by focusing on its specific manifestations. Thus, this course focuses on how China has managed the challenges of globalization. China is a particularly useful case study because it failed the challenges of globalization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For an ancient civilization such as China, this failure had tremendous impact on its national pride. The Chinese refer to this historical juncture as the \"century of shame.\" Towards the end of the 20th century and the onset of the 21st, China faced again the challenges of globalization and has arisen to the tasks in a spectacular fashion, transforming a largely rural and agriculture economy into the world's second largest economic power. This amazing transformation is leading some to proclaim that the 21st century will belong to China! Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

The findings that have been emerged from this recent explosion of research are exciting and important for several reasons. They provide fresh insights into the nature of the uniquely human capacity for language, and they have significant implications for understanding and treating language disorders that result from brain injury.

This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD:  reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism.

We will explore reactions to, and the results of, the spread of American culture both inside and outside the United States. By studying traditional cultural forms like art, music, design, literature, film, and technology the course will build a foundation from which to understand the configuration of American culture. Yet the course will also emphasize American culture expression, that in the forms of television, advertising, sport, cartoons, social media, video games, fashion, food, drugs, and automobiles, have transcended the geographical boundaries of the United States to engage in global interplays of material cultural exchange.",

As such, the following questions will drive this course: What are American Studies methods? Why are certain methodologies utilized (i.e., for what purpose)? How does one conduct research in American Studies? What method(s) should you use in your own research inquiry? And finally, what are some potential drawbacks in using a certain methodology for your project? This is a graduate seminar, and your active participation in discussions is mandatory. You will be asked to submit weekly discussion questions, lead five seminar discussions on selected topics from the required readings, and complete six assignments. The final assignment will include the background and methodological components of a research proposal.",

In this course, we will examine the emergence of race and ethnicity as concepts, and how they shape our everyday lives. We will be guided by the following questions: Why do we study race and ethnicity? How and why are they relevant in our society? How do we experience race and ethnicity, and how has this changed over time? Topics include multiculturalism and diversity; media representations; racism and discrimination; colorism; racial hierarchies; immigration; and different domains of racial inequality.",

We will investigate how art has been used as a tool to transform cultural perspectives, alter policies, and promote social change. We will explore a range of artists whose methodologies, materials and approach challenge the cultural norms. From printmakers to musicians, to choreographers, to performance artists, students will engage and evaluate the act of art-making as a tactic of resistance and the responses to those acts. We will investigate readings that argue for and against the need for artists to make work that politically challenge their society. Once a foundation of knowledge has been laid, we will turn to the creative process through an investigation of materials and practices - performance, mixed media, and photography. Students will research, watch, discuss, create, and perform their own projects that promote social transformation.",

The case studies examined in the course may include past, present, and hypothetical engineering successes and failures; analyses will require engineering skills combined with understanding of cultural perspectives of local communities and cultural context (i.e., sociological, anthropological, and historical information and analyses that contribute to cultural understanding). This humanities-infused approach will encourage students to develop a new mindset--a way of seeing current and hypothetical engineering plans, projects, and impacts through local communities' pasts and presents, unique values, perspectives, and daily ways of life. Taught in Spanish.",

This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associated with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism.

        "description": "This course examines how genes regulate development and function of the brain to ultimately influence behavior. Genetics has come to be an important aspect of research in almost every field of Neuroscience and Psychology ranging from neural development to cognitive function and dysfunction. However, many students have not had the opportunity to explore this in their studies to date. Therefore, the goal of this course is to provide students with the background needed to understand and think critically about the genetic components of Neuroscience and behavioral research. Numerous questions will be explored mainly through discussion of research papers. Lectures by the professor will fill in background knowledge needed to understand the readings. The questions explored will include: What are chromosomes and genes? What do they do? How do they do it? How do genes control development of the brain? How are single genes manipulated in animals to study their effects on behavior? How can genes associated with normal or abnormal behavior be identified? What has been learned from gene-behavior studies in animals? in humans? What do these studies tell us about the nature-nurture controversy? In addition to exploring these more traditional aspects of behavioral genetics we will address the 3 most exciting recent developments. These include the use of transgenic primate models, selective remote control of specific neural circuits using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and epigenetics, which helps explain how environmental factors and behavior itself can change gene activity and how these changes may be transmitted from one generation to the next. Many behaviors could be used to explore the principles these questions address. The readings will be selected from papers that focus on learning &amp; memory and mental illness. However, if students are interested in other behaviors, papers that involve those behaviors and serve our purposes can be substituted. Grading will be based mainly on informal presentations of papers and participation in discussions of these papers. Permission of department required.",

To make the distinction more precise, we prefer to use the term critical cross-cultural science education instead of science education when referring to the teaching and learning of science in the increasingly culturally diverse context of schools in the US. Critical cross-cultural science education is defined as the process of actively engaging students in collaborative inquiry about what science is; whose interests are served by science; who decides what science is and what gets funded as science; and what kinds of individual and collective roles individuals could play as informed and responsible citizens in supporting the advancement of science to benefit society.

This graduate-level course emphasizes charactering demand and supply of agricultural markets and understanding forces that determine commodity and food prices. It also aims to cover a set of economic studies of prices and assist students in applying theoretical frameworks and time-series econometrics to empirical analysis of agricultural prices. In addition to studying prices in perfectly competitive markets, the first half of the course highlights several classic models of consumer demand and agricultural supply, prices under imperfect competition, price spreads (marketing margins), and the economics of information. The second half of the course focuses on empirical price analysis. Popular time-series econometric tools are introduced to study price relationships over space and time, price discovery mechanisms, and functions of futures markets.",

We will begin with issues of definition, and theoretical and empirical approaches to the study of terrorism. We will then delve into the history and evolution of the tactic (taking time to study some of the more notorious organizations). At this point in time it is critical that we look at both domestic--particularly in the United States--and transnational forms of terrorism. The study of terrorism is rife with puzzles that we will explore. Why resort to violence in the first place? How and why do groups evolve over time? How and why do some groups end, and others continue for years? Why are some individuals/groups not classified as terrorists? What are the consequences of terrorism? We will also look closely at counterterrorism policy. What are the most effective ways to respond to terrorism? What doesn't work? How do policies differ between states? To what extent is there global cooperation on counterterrorism? We will conclude the class by taking a critical look at US counterterrorism policy and the massive counterterrorism apparatus that has developed in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001. Should counterterrorism dominate US national security priorities to the degree it does?",

Most classes will begin with a guest speaker giving a brief introduction to a particular area or topic within philosophy. Students will have a short reading assigned for each class period that will be discussed with the instructor following the guest's presentation. The course readings will be, as best as possible, related to the area/topic introduced by the guest. Certain classes will be dedicated solely to career/professionalization interests and will feature guests with expertise in these areas. The professionalization experts will help students develop their career goals, identify possible internships and scholarships to pursue while a student at Purdue, and develop career goals for after they have graduated. Finally, certain classes will be dedicated to writing and the development of the final project, which will include a proposed 8-semester path of study, a polished resume/CV, and career/professionalization goals.",

This type of work will help to guide the innovation process by gaining insights from testing prototypes and interacting with people to deepen one's understanding of customer needs, market segments, costs of goods, competitor operations, and market strategies. At the conclusion of the course, students will pitch a viable design solution and business model for a validated problem to a variety of potential investors and/or stakeholders. Note: This class engages the material in both the classroom and innovation labs. Students of all levels of experience will explore tools/programs related to computer aided design, 3D printing, app development, and digital prototyping.",

This course introduces students to methods used to recover and positively identify human remains, and to evaluate trauma and taphonomy in medico-legal situations. Topics include an overview of historical and current developments in the field. Students will develop a comprehensive understanding of the sequential order of applied work from the search for forensic scenes through the recovery of remains, and skeletal analysis in the laboratory.",

The course focuses on the principles, tools, and procedures used in the design-build project delivery method.

Traditional project delivery methods, Design-Bid-Build, Construction Manager as Agent, `Fast Track', and other `rip and read' methods are losing popularity to project delivery methods that take a more collaborative approach. Collaboration requires a different way of thinking about a capital construction project and working with others in project delivery. Constructors must move from a transactional, arms-length relationship where the project is viewed as a low-price commodity to a full-suite delivery of services resulting in a high-value product. This requires collaboration with the Owner and other members of the project delivery process, something that has been missing from traditional project delivery methods. Active student participation is required. Student participation will be facilitated through assigned presentations, in-class projects, field trips to local projects, and guest lectures. Students who complete the course and achieve DBIA's minimum requirements (Fundamentals of Project Delivery, Principles of Design-Building Project Delivery, Post Award, and Contracts &amp; Risk Management) will be eligible for recognition by DBIA.",

A thorough understanding of how game engines work is therefore a requisite element of the game development process and lever for research in most domains involving interactive simulations and games. As game engine development, research, and application is a large and complex topic, the course material is distributed across two semesters. In addition to the continuation of technical topics this course also emphasizes the experiential, conceptual, and aesthetic dimensions of game development, prioritizing implementation completeness with creative, aesthetically-pleasing implementations that are informed by current research. As research in this field continues to rapidly iterate, the latest findings are incorporated into each new offering of the course, refreshing its content as the technology evolves in its implementation and theoretical underpinnings. Production of original research focused upon an aspect of game development or game engine design is required. Permission of instructor required.",

The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associated with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of impact of ASD on the family and society.",

The course will be divided into two sections. During the first section, we will discuss the cellular and organismal events that occur following virus infection, including viral entry, replication, modulation of cell biology by viral proteins, the host immune response to infection, evasion of the immune response by viruses, and resulting virus-induced disease. The emphasis of this first section will be on the general strategies used by viruses to establish and maintain infection in a population. In the second section, we will discuss in relative detail our current understanding of select important human viruses including influenza, HIV, smallpox, the herpesviruses, and tumor-causing viruses. The objective of this section will be to understand how the unique aspects of each virus's biology affect the outcome of infection with these pathogens. In addition to virus-associated diseases, we will discuss potential ways that viruses may provide symbiotic benefits to their hosts and thereby shape the course of human evolution.  Throughout the course, we will emphasize societal and political aspects of virology and virus-derived technologies, including vaccine development, the use of viruses as gene therapy vectors, and the threat of viral bioterror of bio-error.",

Approached from a multi-disciplinary perspective this course brings together gene, brain, and behavioral sciences with the aim of developing a better understanding of autism. The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of impact of ASD on the family and society.",

This course will provide a detailed introduction to the field of network science. It will develop common mathematical representations of networks, metrics for identifying important features of networks, generative mechanisms for networks (including both random-graph and strategic network formation perspectives), and tools for studying dynamical processes on networks (such as information cascades, opinion dynamics and interconnected dynamical systems).

The course will then look at principles and tools for tasks like organizing data ('tidy data'), manipulating data ('data carpentry'), querying data (through topics like regular expressions) as well as visualizing data (including interactive visualizations). The material and the homework will encourage development of modular reusable code and reproducible research through ideas such as object-oriented programming and dynamic documents in R Markdown. The last part of the course will study statistical procedures such as least-squares regression, LASSO, Monte Carlo sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo. Besides exams and homework, the course will involve a final project that students can collaborate together on.",

This course is designed to cover the essential elements of biochemistry traditionally covered in a two semester series. Topics to be covered include: Amino acids, peptides and proteins, molecular models and structure-function relationships, enzymes, enzyme kinetics and enzyme mechanisms, carbohydrates and carbohydrate metabolism, aerobic metabolism, lipids and membranes, lipid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism and integration and regulation of metabolism. Special emphasis will be placed on connections between biochemical principles and the fields of medicine, human health and disease, nutrition and biotechnology. This course should serve as excellent preparation for higher-level biochemistry courses as well as standardized pre-health professional exams. CHM 33900 was designed as the 4th semester of the 1-2-1 competency-based curriculum transformation in chemistry as it applies to pre-health professional and life science students at Purdue. However, this course is open to other students who meet the prerequisites.",

Emphasis is on the unity of the phenomena that underlie the preparation, manipulation, and analysis of ion and electron beams and on the analogies between inelastic reactions of ions and electrons, including those with both gaseous and solid targets. Mass spectrometry is covered in some depth, and a number of newer aspects of particle spectroscopy are treated, including ion scattering spectrometry, Rutherford scattering, energy loss spectrometry (ion and electron), ion kinetic energy spectrometry, ion cyclotron resonance and Auger spectrometry. Applications of these techniques feature structural analysis (compositions of mixtures, molecular structure of organics, electronic state assignment in simple ions), chemical preparations (ion implantation), and isotopic analysis. The underlying chemistry is explored, particularly in considering the kinetics and dynamics of unimolecular fragmentation and in terms of the factors that affect the cross-sections of inelastic collisions.

EPCS courses are open to students from all disciplines; each student contributes expertise in his/her academic discipline. Each team consists of a mix of first-year, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Students are encouraged to participate in an EPICS project team for two or more semesters. First-year students participating in EPCS gain insight into the specific project, and more generally, into the design and development process. They attend planning and reporting meetings with the customer and are expected to attend all team meetings. Under mentorship from upper-level students and instructors, they perform and report upon design tasks consistent with their level of discipline expertise.",

The students get familiar with key issues (cost, quality, delivery, and flexibility) and problems (e.g., variability) facing an operations manager.

        "description": "This course is designed to help students more effectively manage self, peers, teams, clients and firms in diverse organizational settings and lead change. People and leaders in organizations are constantly working with members of different backgrounds, social identities, and experiences, fostering increased attention to diversity and inclusion in an employment and organizational context. [1] For example, women represent over half of the labor for 57% (BLS, 2018) [2] but are severely under-represented at senior management levels and in high-paying technical and professional fields (Kossek &amp; Buzzanell, 2018) [3]. Ethnic and racial minorities are also severely under-represented. The U.S. population is increasingly diverse as 40% of the population identifies as racial or ethnic minorities (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2019) including African-American (13.4%), Hispanic-American (18.3%), Asian-American (5.9%), American Indian or Alaska Native (1.3%), and European American (60%) as well as a growing number of individuals who identify with more than one race or ethnicity (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2019) [4]. Further, 26% of the population has some form of disability, and 16% are over the age of 65 (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2018). Many other minority groups can face workplace marginalization challenges such as veterans, minority religious group members (Muslims, Jews, Hinduism; Catholic; Latter-day Saints), immigrants, people with mental or intellectual disabilities, &amp; LGBTQ persons (Stone, Lukaszewski, &amp; Dulebohn, 2020)[5]. When leveraged effectively, these differences in social identity and values can help attract and retain talent, strengthen societal and community economic equality, support organizational and team effectiveness; but when overlooked, or mismanaged, these differences can increase turnover, conflict, stress, talent under-utilization, and harm career and work-life well-being, and productivity. The class focuses on management of gender and diversity for inclusion and equity from an individual employee, leader and team/organizational perspective in a workplace context. The goal of this class is to take a multi-level approach to help you learn how to lead the management of diversity and inclusion through a) improving your ability to work in diverse teams, as well as b) developing your ability to lead, develop, and implement strategies to foster cultural and structural change to support the management of gender and diversity toward enhanced organizational effectiveness. Men, as well as women, majority and minority individuals, will be able to leverage the skills taught in this course when making their own career decisions, as well as when managing, being managed by, or collaborating with others; or leading and changing organizations to support new ways of working. We integrate multiple levels and lenses to understand diversity and inclusion. From an individual leadership perspective, we tackle the question: \"Why does diversity matter in employing organizations and business, what is the state-of-the-art evidence-based knowledge, and what does it mean to me personally in my career and my leadership beliefs.\" Specifically, we focus on the business and social science processes - including attitudes toward in-groups and out-groups, stereotyping, identity, privilege, and power, intersectionality, discrimination, bias, equity influence opportunity, bystander awareness, and perspective taking - this affects how members of different social groups perceive and interact with one another. Since managing social identity increasingly involves managing work-life boundaries and work and non-work public and private selves, we will also learn about authenticity choices and social and public/professional identity boundary management. From an organizational and group perspective, we address the question: \"What are best practices for successful diversity management?\" We will focus on organizational and institutional structures and cultures and their relations to strategies for creating diversity through management practices; how to create an inclusive culture and positive climate for inclusion and talent management, and developing and retaining diverse talent and foster innovation and organizational effectiveness across multiple levels of intervention (individual, group, intergroup, organizational, and societal). We discuss how to conduct an organizational diagnosis of the current diversity climate and barriers and facilitators for creating a multicultural workplace and a flexible environment supportive of many identities, and how assumptions may vary across industry and cultural contexts.",

Next we look at how IT projects have traditionally been managed, and move on to the study of agile methods. We go through some of the most important aspects of agile project management, such as user stories, agile teams an agile planning, execution and tracking. In learning these tools and techniques, we take a hands-on approach wherever possible and use project management software, exercises and case studies.",

The first four weeks will be spent in a classroom setting, with presentations on how to professionally manage a client relationship and how to successfully tackle projects in a challenging STEM start-up and/or established corporate environment. Each project will be completed by teams of 3-5 students, which will be formed at the beginning of the semester. After the initial classroom sessions, the project teams will be on their own, with faculty guidance, running the engagement. The teams will meet with the clients to determine their needs and expectations. The students will do the work and deliver the output including a final presentation to the client.",

This course introduces stress wave propagation in solids, which is the foundation to characterization and understanding of high-rate response of materials. Then, the theoretical background and working principles of high-rate experimental methods are presented to characterize the material response under high-rate loading conditions.

Yet, advances in materials have stagnated due to overly conservative approaches, trial-and-error testing, and long qualification times. Material modeling offers tremendous opportunities to address these issues. This class offers advanced modeling strategies at the intersection of mechanics and materials science for both polycrystalline and composite materials. The course topics are defined as follows: First, advanced micromechanics analysis of modern engineering materials with emphasis on relating elastic microstructural phenomena to the mechanics of material behavior, via the Eshelby inclusion problem and its application to fiber reinforced composites. Second, classical plasticity is summarized via phenomenological and mathematical formulation of the constitutive laws, including yielding, yield surface; von Mises, Tresca yield criteria; Drucker's stability postulate; strain or work hardening, normality rule, perfect plasticity, and stress-strain law. Third, crystal plasticity is discussed, specifically physical and mathematical foundation for plasticity in crystalline materials, with a detailed description of the Bishop and Hill implementation of the Taylor model for deformation of polycrystals. Lastly, concepts of dislocations leading to strengthening mechanisms in metals are discussed: (i) by studying the anisotropy of material and elastoplastic properties at crystal level, microstructural basis for deformation in metals, polymers, and ceramics and (ii) failure mechanisms and toughening in metals, with primary emphasis on work/strain hardening, solid solution hardening, precipitate hardening, and grain boundaries. The course will be comprised of three projects, where the student chooses the topic of the third and final project. Prerequisite: AAE 55300 or equivalent.",

        "description": "To understand climate we describe and synthesize physical processes in the atmosphere and their coupling to the ocean, ice, and land. We quantitatively explore climatology with an equal balance of physical principles and scrutiny of available modern data. Topics include: visualization of atmospheric/land surface/oceanographic climatological data sets; theories of climate dynamics; and climate change. Beginning with radiative balance and simple energy balance models, the course progresses toward understanding the effects of radiative-convective forcing and rotation on the fluid envelopes. Analysis of data in an interactive computer-enabled environment is an important part of the course. By the end of this course, the student should know how the Earth System behaves at large scales and grasp the physical understandings of why. Previous course work in Calculus, Physics, and Chemistry are required as building blocks for this course, and knowledge from these areas will be called upon frequently. Should you be missing this background, please speak with your instructor as soon as possible.",

Students will explore what it means to be ethical in and through an interrogation of our contemporary conceptions of what it means to be human. These interrogations in turn will prompt us to reconsider human creations such as knowledge, culture, and technology, which will push us to genuinely think how humans as a species situate their creations within the realm of what they call Nature. Students will be introduced to the history of environmental studies in the discipline, to the rise of what is now known as \"postcolonial ecocriticism\" to theoretical inquiry into modern technology, and to other recent developments in the fields of environmental studies.",

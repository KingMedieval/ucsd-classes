        "description": "The main goal of this course is to address grand challenges that are of global concern - such as environmental sustainability and energy use, natural and human disasters, and political and economic development - using the ideas and tools of complex adaptive systems. The course addresses these challenges from diverse disciplinary perspectives, from the biological and physical sciences to the social sciences, to engineering. Through the experiments and computer simulations, students will analyze the features of these challenges which make them complex and seek to explain and find solutions to the problems that arise.",

        "description": "Engineers, social scientists, and managers frequently bring people and technology together to address complex problematic situations in an equitable way that benefits people and the environment. Multiple systems concepts and methods have been developed to address these situations, and typical courses in systems focus on a relatively small portion of the rich assortment of available approaches to addressing systems problems. This course introduces students to multiple systems concepts and methods via readings and class lecture. The students then apply these concepts and methods on team-based projects. The course will emphasize critical thinking about how the concepts and methods are applicable to the problematic situations of the projects and how well the project teams were able to perform the required activities.",

As we are entering a new era of AI, the course will also include a brief introduction on how to apply the HCI principles and techniques to AI-powered systems. This course is project-based. Students will form project teams among themselves to work on a semester-long project and apply the user-centered design principles, theories, and techniques that they have learned in class to build a useful and usable interactive system such as a mobile application.

From improving healthcare systems to enhancing the manufacturing capacity of various industrial sectors, the role of Robotics has been acknowledged worldwide. They are now also being considered as necessary tools to build large-scale assistive technologies such as smart vehicles and delivery drones to improve people's quality of life. This course covers topics in robot motion planning, estimation, learning, and control to design algorithms for robots to safely interact with their environments and perform various challenging tasks under constraints. The first part of this course focuses on classical techniques such as search, sampling-based planning, PID control, Model Predictive Control (MPC), and Bayesian Kalman filters. The second part covers modern imitation learning and deep reinforcement learning techniques and their application to planning and decision-making in robotics. The course assumes students are familiar with basic concepts in linear algebra, optimization, elementary probability, statistics, data structures, and algorithms. Students are expected to have good programming and software development skills and have a working knowledge of Python.",

Topics will be chosen from four core areas: Convex Analysis and Optimization, Spectral Methods, Concentration Inequalities, and Discrete Fourier Analysis. Depending on student and instructor interest, additional topics will be chosen and may include applied analysis, coding theory, probabilistic proofs, and more advanced topics in discrete Fourier analysis. Students will read papers in theoretical computer science and machine learning theory using, exploring and extending the covered techniques and tools. Students are expected to be proficient in probability theory, have the maturity to follow and carry out basic analysis proofs, and have completed courses in calculus, linear algebra, discrete mathematics, and analysis of algorithms. More specifically, the course expects mastery of the material covered in Calculus III, Linear Algebra, Probability, Foundations of CS, and Analysis of Algorithms.",

Two practical benefits of randomization are its simplicity and speed. Deep and important computational complexity connections have been developed,  from bridging the gap between discrete and continuous optimization, bypassing deterministic barriers in online settings, summarizing massive data in polylogarithmic space, probabilistically checkable proofs, privacy enhancing techniques, modeling the web and other large networks, and sparsifying and compressing complicated combinatorial structures such as graphs. Randomization is an essential  key ingredient in the algorithmic breakthroughs today and in the future. This course presents the basic concepts in the design and analysis of randomized algorithms and shows how to apply them to algorithms for a wide range of problems. The course covers a broad range of problems benefitting from randomized computation including data structures, graph algorithms, online algorithms, geometric algorithms, streaming algorithms, derandomization techniques, and tools for probabilistic analysis of algorithms.",

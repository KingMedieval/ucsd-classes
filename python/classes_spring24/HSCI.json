This job requires a number of approaches to achieve this aim, including employee training, hazard identification and abatement, safety policy development, and incident investigation. The health and safety manager often forms a bridge between upper management and frontline employees. As such, the successful health and safety manager needs to skill sets which transfer across organizational levels. This course will explore strategies managing an effective health and safety program within an organization. Management strategies will be viewed from multiple perspectives. In relation to the frontline employee, topics will be explored to help engage employees in safe behaviors and dealing with situations in which failures occur, resulting in accidents. The upper management perspective will focus on the establishment of a safety management system and effective techniques for measuring and reporting safety performance. A final perspective will consider both the frontline employee and upper management. This perspective will explore strategies to establish a positive safety culture within an organization to bring the frontline employees and upper management together in their vision of a safe and health workplace.",

Today, toxicology encompasses much broader areas, including the study of endogenous compounds, physical agents, and even using toxicants as research tools. Basic and introductory toxicology courses cover the principles of toxicant metabolism and target organ toxicity. This course, Analytical Toxicology and Toxicologic Pathology is focused on the research and clinical applications of these principles. Two major areas will be covered: (1) principles of toxicant detection in biological matrices and (2) the assessment of pathological effects caused by toxicant exposure in biological systems. Laboratory sessions associated with each major topic allow students to have hands-on experience in these advanced analytical and pathological technologies. This course provides a unique opportunity for students to learn techniques that research and clinical toxicologists use daily in scientific or clinical laboratories. The course is suitable to both graduate and upper-class undergraduate students who are interested in toxicology, forensic science, veterinary medicine, environmental and occupational health, food toxicity, pharmaceutical drug testing, medical laboratory science, and general human and children's health.",

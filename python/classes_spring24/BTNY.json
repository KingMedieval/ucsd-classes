Lectures and laboratory exercises will cover mechanisms and processes of plant ecology, physiology and genetics. Our goal is to convey how these levels of organization all contribute to the relative success of plants within and across environments. Throughout the course, an emphasis will be made on the means by which scientific data is collected and interpreted, and key experiments performed in the lab component will be used to illustrate this process.",

The course also discusses a wide range of subjects related to microbiology, including medical microbiology, but it has a strong emphasis on the botanical and environmental sciences. One particular characteristic that separates it from other microbiology courses is the reduced emphasis upon bacteriology, with discussions of the protists and viruses and, especially of the fungi, occurring in greater detail than the other general microbiology courses available.",

Many plant pathogens and diseases have increased their geographic distribution and intensity in the U.S. and the world. A lack of epidemiological understanding can exacerbate problems and significantly challenge the management of diseases at the field level. This course is an introduction to the epidemiological basis of disease management strategies. The course includes concepts in botanical epidemiology, disease assessment and measurement, disease modeling, epidemics comparison, and a revision of the traditional plant disease control principles. Plant Disease Epidemiology is an upper-level course for students interested in plant pathology, agronomy, data-driven Ag, national or international agriculture, or closely related areas. Although some pathosystems are used as model systems, Plant Disease Epidemiology is not a \"how-to\" course on controlling specific plant diseases.",

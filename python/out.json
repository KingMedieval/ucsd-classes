Yet, advances in materials have stagnated due to overly conservative approaches, trial-and-error testing, and long qualification times. Material modeling offers tremendous opportunities to address these issues. This class offers advanced modeling strategies at the intersection of mechanics and materials science for both polycrystalline and composite materials. The course topics are defined as follows: First, advanced micromechanics analysis of modern engineering materials with emphasis on relating elastic microstructural phenomena to the mechanics of material behavior, via the Eshelby inclusion problem and its application to fiber reinforced composites. Second, classical plasticity is summarized via phenomenological and mathematical formulation of the constitutive laws, including yielding, yield surface; von Mises, Tresca yield criteria; Drucker's stability postulate; strain or work hardening, normality rule, perfect plasticity, and stress-strain law. Third, crystal plasticity is discussed, specifically physical and mathematical foundation for plasticity in crystalline materials, with a detailed description of the Bishop and Hill implementation of the Taylor model for deformation of polycrystals. Lastly, concepts of dislocations leading to strengthening mechanisms in metals are discussed: (i) by studying the anisotropy of material and elastoplastic properties at crystal level, microstructural basis for deformation in metals, polymers, and ceramics and (ii) failure mechanisms and toughening in metals, with primary emphasis on work/strain hardening, solid solution hardening, precipitate hardening, and grain boundaries. The course will be comprised of three projects, where the student chooses the topic of the third and final project. Prerequisite: AAE 55300 or equivalent.",

Students will manipulate, check and insert data from a variety of sources, use that data as input to distributed hydrologic model, analyze model output and learn methods for properly documenting their data use (creation of metadata) and long-term archival storage of those data. Skills learned should be applicable to most computer operating systems, but the majority of work for this class will be done within the Unix/Linux environment. Students taking this course should have experience with one or more programming languages, including but not limited to C, Fortran, Perl, Python, java, Basic, or two writing scripts or macros within programs such as MatLab, S-Plus, R, SAS.",

We will explore reactions to, and the results of, the spread of American culture both inside and outside the United States. By studying traditional cultural forms like art, music, design, literature, film, and technology the course will build a foundation from which to understand the configuration of American culture. Yet the course will also emphasize American culture expression, that in the forms of television, advertising, sport, cartoons, social media, video games, fashion, food, drugs, and automobiles, have transcended the geographical boundaries of the United States to engage in global interplays of material cultural exchange.",

As such, the following questions will drive this course: What are American Studies methods? Why are certain methodologies utilized (i.e., for what purpose)? How does one conduct research in American Studies? What method(s) should you use in your own research inquiry? And finally, what are some potential drawbacks in using a certain methodology for your project? This is a graduate seminar, and your active participation in discussions is mandatory. You will be asked to submit weekly discussion questions, lead five seminar discussions on selected topics from the required readings, and complete six assignments. The final assignment will include the background and methodological components of a research proposal.",

We will present a historical perspective of how ideas and data have shaped Cosmology through the centuries. In addition, we will review the theoretical models that are in agreement with the current observations. Our goal will be to provide the students with a broad overview of the current research in Cosmology with an eye toward stimulating the students curiosity about the many questions still awaiting answers in this field.",

The various disciplines in the life sciences are generating a wealth of experimental and annotation data. Today's graduate students need experience with modern tools that can help them to access, explore, analyze, interpret and manage the data that they generate in the lab. Students will use the R programming language and packages from Bioconductor, the R bioinformatics project, as their principal tools for this course. Students will develop workflows in R that bridge established algorithms for bioinformatics such as limma, edgeR or DESeq2, incorporating methods to import, QC, transform and visualize genome-scale datasets derived from next generation sequencing experiments. A critical aspect of bioinformatics that is often inadequate is workflow documentation. This course will use Rmarkdown to integrate computer code, data and results to manage complex bioinformatics projects. The class has lecture, lab and distance components. Lectures will focus on the theoretical and biological aspects of bioinformatics analysis using recent examples from the literature. In lab, students will work on programming exercises or projects using published datasets. Advanced students will also have the opportunity to work with their own data. Distance instruction will include R tutorials and videos that students can work through at their own pace (subject to completion deadlines). Particular emphasis will be placed on the theoretical and practical limitations of next generation sequencing data. No prior computer programming experience is required, but it is assumed that students have a firm grasp of the fundamental principles of molecular biology and how they relate to complex processes such as gene expression and genome organization.

The emphasis of this first section will be on the general strategies used by viruses to establish and maintain infection in a population. In the second section, we will discuss in relative detail our current understanding of select important human viruses including influenza, HIV, smallpox, the herpesviruses, and tumor-causing viruses. The objective of this section will be to understand how the unique aspects of each virus's biology affect the outcome of infection with these pathogens. In addition to virus-associated diseases, we will discuss potential ways that viruses may provide symbiotic benefits to their hosts and thereby shape the course of human evolution.  Throughout the course, we will emphasize societal and political aspects of virology and virus-derived technologies, including vaccine development, the use of viruses as gene therapy vectors, and the threat of viral bioterror of bio-error.",

Topics will include understanding the evolutionary organization of genes (genomics), the structure and function of gene products (proteomics), and the dynamics of gene expression in biological processes (transcriptomics). Inherently, bioinformatics is interdisciplinary, melding various applications of computational science with biology. This jointly taught course introduces analytical methods from biology, statistics and computer science that are necessary for bioinformatics investigations. The course is intended for junior and senior undergraduates from various science backgrounds. Our objective is to develop the skills of both tool users and tool designers in this important new field of research.",

Course content includes market analysis techniques to link technology attributes to opportunity and vice versa, combinatorial business design and planning methods, strategic innovation theories, competitive analysis, methods of emergent strategy and risk mitigation, as well as examination of team building, firm influence and navigation, and organizational design principles. Emphasis throughout is placed on the implications of research and development uncertainty, long-lifecycle economics, and the management of subcontracts and multi-disciplinary teams often encountered when developing and delivering complex engineering outputs. Case studies are used to contrast the challenges faced when creating new businesses (entrepreneurial) with those encountered in attempts to grow an existing enterprise (intrapreneurial). Coursework and project activities also facilitate development of business acumen, and skill building in conceptual thinking, synthesis, and persuasive communication. This course is particularly relevant for engineering students intending to progress into managerial roles in technology or R&D driven organizations. This course can be counted toward the College of Engineering Minor in Innovation and Transformational Change and the Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship (BDMCE) Certificate in Entrepreneurship and Innovation.",

The course focuses on the principles, tools, and procedures used in the design-build project delivery method. It provides students with sufficient education to become certified (following additional examination) by the Design Build Institute of America as an Associate Member and dependent on employment experience, a full Member. Traditional project delivery methods, Design-Bid-Build, Construction Manager as Agent, `Fast Track', and other `rip and read' methods are losing popularity to project delivery methods that take a more collaborative approach. Collaboration requires a different way of thinking about a capital construction project and working with others in project delivery. Constructors must move from a transactional, arms-length relationship where the project is viewed as a low-price commodity to a full-suite delivery of services resulting in a high-value product. This requires collaboration with the Owner and other members of the project delivery process, something that has been missing from traditional project delivery methods. Active student participation is required. Student participation will be facilitated through assigned presentations, in-class projects, field trips to local projects, and guest lectures. Students who complete the course and achieve DBIA's minimum requirements (Fundamentals of Project Delivery, Principles of Design-Building Project Delivery, Post Award, and Contracts & Risk Management) will be eligible for recognition by DBIA.",

The two courses are structured similarly but cover different aspects of development on and within game engines. This course introduces students to the fundamental technologies and skills required to develop video games using a modern game engine. Students are taught using a student-led, active-learning pedagogy in which students co-develop and present lectures, demonstrations, and assignments for their peers, with facilitation by the course instructor. The focus of this course is primarily on the technical, functional, and theoretical dimensions of game development, prioritizing technical soundness over design and creativity (which are covered more explicitly in a separate course). As research in this field continues to rapidly iterate, the latest findings are incorporated into each new offering of the course, refreshing its content as the technology evolves in its implementation and theoretical underpinnings.

Emphasis is on the unity of the phenomena that underlie the preparation, manipulation, and analysis of ion and electron beams and on the analogies between inelastic reactions of ions and electrons, including those with both gaseous and solid targets. Mass spectrometry is covered in some depth, and a number of newer aspects of particle spectroscopy are treated, including ion scattering spectrometry, Rutherford scattering, energy loss spectrometry (ion and electron), ion kinetic energy spectrometry, ion cyclotron resonance and Auger spectrometry. Applications of these techniques feature structural analysis (compositions of mixtures, molecular structure of organics, electronic state assignment in simple ions), chemical preparations (ion implantation), and isotopic analysis. The underlying chemistry is explored, particularly in considering the kinetics and dynamics of unimolecular fragmentation and in terms of the factors that affect the cross-sections of inelastic collisions.

And it's writing about things in your own back yard that are exotic to everyone else - a local farmer's market, historic site, restaurant, museum. In this class, you will explore the various ways travel writers can excite and assist readers.",

We will investigate how art has been used as a tool to transform cultural perspectives, alter policies, and promote social change. We will explore a range of artists whose methodologies, materials and approach challenge the cultural norms. From printmakers to musicians, to choreographers, to performance artists, students will engage and evaluate the act of art-making as a tactic of resistance and the responses to those acts. We will investigate readings that argue for and against the need for artists to make work that politically challenge their society. Once a foundation of knowledge has been laid, we will turn to the creative process through an investigation of materials and practices - performance, mixed media, and photography. Students will research, watch, discuss, create, and perform their own projects that promote social transformation.",

While the specific details of such networks will depend on the application, the last few decades have seen the emergence of an underlying \"science'' of networks, comprised of a common language (graph theory) for representing large-scale networks, along with mathematical models and analytical techniques for studying structure and dynamics. This course will provide a detailed introduction to the field of network science. It will develop common mathematical representations of networks, metrics for identifying important features of networks, generative mechanisms for networks (including both random-graph and strategic network formation perspectives), and tools for studying dynamical processes on networks (such as information cascades, opinion dynamics and interconnected dynamical systems). This is an introductory course that establishes several of the fundamental tools and concepts in network science, and requires only an undergraduate background in probability and linear algebra.",

To make the distinction more precise, we prefer to use the term critical cross-cultural science education instead of science education when referring to the teaching and learning of science in the increasingly culturally diverse context of schools in the US. Critical cross-cultural science education is defined as the process of actively engaging students in collaborative inquiry about what science is; whose interests are served by science; who decides what science is and what gets funded as science; and what kinds of individual and collective roles individuals could play as informed and responsible citizens in supporting the advancement of science to benefit society.

Work in the course aims to construct answers to the following three questions: (1) How do theories of human learning, development, and epistemology help us think about engineering? (2) How do they relate to engineering education? (3) How do they inform research method and practice in engineering education? No restrictions. It is helpful, however, for students to have engaged in prior reading-and writing- intensive courses that required them to synthesize large amounts of information.

The course analyzes disciplinary differences in approaching the ethical, the human, and environmental problems such as sustainability, development, biodiversity, global security, and climate change. Students will explore what it means to be ethical in and through an interrogation of our contemporary conceptions of what it means to be human. These interrogations in turn will prompt us to reconsider human creations such as knowledge, culture, and technology, which will push us to genuinely think how humans as a species situate their creations within the realm of what they call Nature. Students will be introduced to the history of environmental studies in the discipline, to the rise of what is now known as \"postcolonial ecocriticism\" to theoretical inquiry into modern technology, and to other recent developments in the fields of environmental studies.",

        "description": "This course introduces students to the engineering profession using physics-based, multidisciplinary, societally relevant content. Students develop engineering approaches to systems, generate and explore creative and innovative ideas, and use of computational methods to support design decisions. In particular, the students will develop the ability to model and investigate physical systems at the microscopic and macroscopic levels with a focus on vectors analysis, linear momentum, angular momentum, work-energy, and solid material interactions. Design challenges and projects will explore a wide range of natural phenomena experimentally and computationally (utilizing Matlab and Python) and engage students in innovative thinking across the engineering disciplines at Purdue. They will learn the basics of descriptive statistics, data analysis, sensitivity analysis, and decision-making. Students experience the process of design and analysis in engineering including how to work effectively in teams. Students also develop skills in project management, engineering fundamentals, oral and graphical communication, logical thinking, and modern engineering tools.",

The course approaches these themes through discussion of: the relation and interaction of engineering, science, technology, and society; the historical origins and development of engineering as a profession; diversity issues in engineering and other STEM fields; engineering in cross-national/cultural contexts; and contemporary challenges related to globalization, ethics, and sustainability. In summary, the course is designed to help students understand what it means to identify as, and/or work with, engineers. Recitation sections and/or independent projects (at the instructor's discretion) provide further opportunities for students to expand their knowledge and improve their skills in relation to course themes.",

Projects of at least one year in duration are intended to solve real problems that are defined in consultation with customers from not-for-profit community and educational organizations. EPCS courses are open to students from all disciplines; each student contributes expertise in his/her academic discipline. Each team consists of a mix of first-year, sophomores, juniors, and seniors.  Students are encouraged to participate in an EPICS project for two or more semesters. First-year students participating in EPICS gain insight into the specific project, and more generally, into the design and development process. Under mentorship from upper-level students and instructors, they perform and report upon design tasks consistent with their level of discipline expertise.",

The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associated with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism.

In this course, we will examine how the invention of calculating machines - analogue and then digital - has developed in tandem with philosophical and scientific theories of human thinking and intelligence. In their turn, the latter developed as a response to changing social, political, and economic currents.",

We will study vaccines and beer-making in the 19th century, cell culture, birth control pills, and DNA sequencing in the 20th century, and 21st-century genome editing and synthetic biology, for example.

It, being your first or one of your first courses in the Honors College, is designed to help you hone some of the fundamental learning outcomes of an honors education: interdisciplinary thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving, research thinking, collaboration, and global awareness. You will also engage with the pillars of the Honors College and develop community within the Honors College. To accomplish these objectives, the course is simultaneously project-based and experiential. You will work in multi-disciplinary teams on applied research that emphasizes critical and multi-dimensional thinking about real-world problems. Through project-based learning, you will move your skills beyond identifying and understanding a problem to identifying and formulating solutions to that problem. The problem addressed in the course is local or global in scope and has social, economic, political, and/or environmental implications for our local and/or global community as well as begs a multi-disciplinary, innovative solution. Continuing in the vein of experiential learning and of building your honors ethos, you will attend events (some as a class, others individually) and participate in programs in the Honors College and across campus that embody the Honors College's pillars: Community and Global Engagement, Leadership, Research, and Interdisciplinary Academics. You will curate a schedule of events that take place during the semester and reflect on these experiences. Permission of department required.",

The course trains students to recognize how race-and-ethnicity-based inequities intersect with issues of class, gender, and/or sexuality, and how these intersections articulate themselves in/through culture. Students will grapple with the colonial, national, transatlantic, trans-cultural, and diasporic underpinnings of culture. Topics that will be explored will vary each semester, but to attend to the diverse ways in which students learn and demonstrate their learning, all sections will use interdisciplinary materials like songs, films, video games, sporting events, poems, neighborhood maps, photographs, fine art pieces, oral histories, interviews, and newspapers, in addition to traditional/scholarly publications.",

We will ask ourselves how relations of power inform the ways technologies are designed and experienced, as well as how power shapes dominant and insurgent approaches to achieving technological justice.

The course aims to provide a working knowledge of the vocabulary of OM, to help students develop an ability to design, improve, and manage processes by answering the questions: What are the components of a process? How should various process parameters such as capacities, output, and work-in-process inventories be calculated? What are the major opportunities for improving a process? The students get familiar with key issues (cost, quality, delivery, and flexibility) and problems (e.g., variability) facing an operations manager. At the end of the course, the students analyze operational strengths and weaknesses of a local firm, suggest some improvements of its operations and present the results.",

Firms are tasked with understanding how to utilize intellectual property as a competitive advantage in multiple market contexts. In the current economic environment, intellectual assets can be the largest portion of a firm's total wealth. Strategic management of these assets is very critical. Managing intellectual property is about transforming a firm's ideas, know-how, etc., into learning, products, and ultimately cash flow. In Managing Intellectual Property, we examine this topic by viewing intellectual property as both a legal asset (property ownership) and business asset (value-adding). The focus of Managing Intellectual Property is on the integration of IP generation, IP protection, and strategizing functions of the firm in creating value with an IP portfolio. Concepts and frameworks discussed/developed in lecture are exercised in case studies from multiple contexts.",

The overall goal of this class is to help you become a more effective professional and leader in a global world on and off the job by providing information, tools and multicultural opportunities to increase conceptual and practical understanding of how national cultures shape employment settings and its implications for your own behavior as a global business professional and leader who implements human capital and organizational strategies, policies, and practices in a cross-national context. This course will also increase knowledge of and ability to implement current global human capital, international HRM, and organizational strategies for MNES and domestically. To achieve these goals, student engagement in class sessions, and willingness to share perspectives and opinions, and application of course readings and materials, are critical to the success of this course. A range of participative learning methods are used to facilitate an active classroom environment, including learning log journaling, case analysis, experiential exercises, small group projects, break out discussions, company guest speakers, and self-assessments. The role of the instructor in this course is not always to provide \"the\" answer, but to create an environment where you can collectively explore, examine and experiment with students' own ideas and share ideas and perspectives on working and managing global firms.",

        "subjectCode": "MGMT",
        "courseCode": "55500",
        "description": "This course is designed to help students more effectively manage self, peers, teams, clients and firms in diverse organizational settings and lead change. People and leaders in organizations are constantly working with members of different backgrounds, social identities, and experiences, fostering increased attention to diversity and inclusion in an employment and organizational context. [1] For example, women represent over half of the labor for 57% (BLS, 2018) [2] but are severely under-represented at senior management levels and in high-paying technical and professional fields (Kossek & Buzzanell, 2018) [3]. Ethnic and racial minorities are also severely under-represented. The U.S. population is increasingly diverse as 40% of the population identifies as racial or ethnic minorities (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2019) including African-American (13.4%), Hispanic-American (18.3%), Asian-American (5.9%), American Indian or Alaska Native (1.3%), and European American (60%) as well as a growing number of individuals who identify with more than one race or ethnicity (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2019) [4]. Further, 26% of the population has some form of disability, and 16% are over the age of 65 (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2018). Many other minority groups can face workplace marginalization challenges such as veterans, minority religious group members (Muslims, Jews, Hinduism; Catholic; Latter-day Saints), immigrants, people with mental or intellectual disabilities, & LGBTQ persons (Stone, Lukaszewski, & Dulebohn, 2020)[5]. When leveraged effectively, these differences in social identity and values can help attract and retain talent, strengthen societal and community economic equality, support organizational and team effectiveness; but when overlooked, or mismanaged, these differences can increase turnover, conflict, stress, talent under-utilization, and harm career and work-life well-being, and productivity. The class focuses on management of gender and diversity for inclusion and equity from an individual employee, leader and team/organizational perspective in a workplace context. The goal of this class is to take a multi-level approach to help you learn how to lead the management of diversity and inclusion through a) improving your ability to work in diverse teams, as well as b) developing your ability to lead, develop, and implement strategies to foster cultural and structural change to support the management of gender and diversity toward enhanced organizational effectiveness. Men, as well as women, majority and minority individuals, will be able to leverage the skills taught in this course when making their own career decisions, as well as when managing, being managed by, or collaborating with others; or leading and changing organizations to support new ways of working. We integrate multiple levels and lenses to understand diversity and inclusion. From an individual leadership perspective, we tackle the question: \"Why does diversity matter in employing organizations and business, what is the state-of-the-art evidence-based knowledge, and what does it mean to me personally in my career and my leadership beliefs.\" Specifically, we focus on the business and social science processes - including attitudes toward in-groups and out-groups, stereotyping, identity, privilege, and power, intersectionality, discrimination, bias, equity influence opportunity, bystander awareness, and perspective taking - this affects how members of different social groups perceive and interact with one another. Since managing social identity increasingly involves managing work-life boundaries and work and non-work public and private selves, we will also learn about authenticity choices and social and public/professional identity boundary management. From an organizational and group perspective, we address the question: \"What are best practices for successful diversity management?\" We will focus on organizational and institutional structures and cultures and their relations to strategies for creating diversity through management practices; how to create an inclusive culture and positive climate for inclusion and talent management, and developing and retaining diverse talent and foster innovation and organizational effectiveness across multiple levels of intervention (individual, group, intergroup, organizational, and societal). We discuss how to conduct an organizational diagnosis of the current diversity climate and barriers and facilitators for creating a multicultural workplace and a flexible environment supportive of many identities, and how assumptions may vary across industry and cultural contexts.",

Our students are expected to provide various accounting support services that are related to financial accounting & reporting, managerial accounting, business planning, and/or tax issues. The format of the course is very open. The first four weeks will be spent in a classroom setting, with presentations on how to professionally manage a client relationship and how to successfully tackle projects in a challenging STEM start-up and/or established corporate environment. Each project will be completed by teams of 3-5 students, which will be formed at the beginning of the semester. After the initial classroom sessions, the project teams will be on their own, with faculty guidance, running the engagement. The teams will meet with the clients to determine their needs and expectations. The students will do the work and deliver the output including a final presentation to the client.",

These questions will lead us to consider the future of food and food policy in the United States. Can Americans develop food policy that supports the agricultural economy AND promotes the consumption of healthy foods? Could our agricultural system support this? We will learn about and explore these questions with class discussions, debate, research, guest lectures, relevant documentary films, and thought-provoking readings that present a variety of viewpoints.

Most classes will begin with a guest speaker giving a brief introduction to a particular area or topic within philosophy. Students will have a short reading assigned for each class period that will be discussed with the instructor following the guest's presentation. The course readings will be, as best as possible, related to the area/topic introduced by the guest. Certain classes will be dedicated solely to career/professionalization interests and will feature guests with expertise in these areas. The professionalization experts will help students develop their career goals, identify possible internships and scholarships to pursue while a student at Purdue, and develop career goals for after they have graduated. Finally, certain classes will be dedicated to writing and the development of the final project, which will include a proposed 8-semester path of study, a polished resume/CV, and career/professionalization goals.",

The course will have one 50-minute lecture and two 110-minute laboratory meetings each week. The course content is consistent with the CAEP (Council for the Accreditation of Education Preparation) K-6 Elementary Teacher Preparation Standards (Standard 2: Understanding and Applying Content and Curricular  Knowledge for Teaching in Physical Science and Engineering Design) and the NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards) Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs) for the Physical Sciences (Physical Sciences PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4) as well as many of the Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs). The course will be divided into four units: 1) Matter and Interactions 2) Motion and Stability 3) Energy and 4) Waves and their applications. All of these units will be delivered through the paradigm of solving engineering design problems. Engineering design involves many different practices: problem definition, model development and use, investigation, analysis and interpretation of data, application of mathematics and computational thinking, and determination of solutions.",

We will begin with issues of definition, and theoretical and empirical approaches to the study of terrorism. We will then delve into the history and evolution of the tactic (taking time to study some of the more notorious organizations). At this point in time it is critical that we look at both domestic--particularly in the United States--and transnational forms of terrorism. The study of terrorism is rife with puzzles that we will explore. Why resort to violence in the first place? How and why do groups evolve over time? How and why do some groups end, and others continue for years? Why are some individuals/groups not classified as terrorists? What are the consequences of terrorism? We will also look closely at counterterrorism policy. What are the most effective ways to respond to terrorism? What doesn't work? How do policies differ between states? To what extent is there global cooperation on counterterrorism? We will conclude the class by taking a critical look at US counterterrorism policy and the massive counterterrorism apparatus that has developed in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001. Should counterterrorism dominate US national security priorities to the degree it does?",

During the past few decades, there has been an unprecedented increase in studies on these topics, due in large part to the widespread use of highly sensitive brain mapping techniques that enable researchers to identify relationships between particular brain areas and particular language functions. The findings that have been emerged from this recent explosion of research are exciting and important for several reasons. They provide fresh insights into the nature of the uniquely human capacity for language, and they have significant implications for understanding and treating language disorders that result from brain injury.",

The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history of ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associated with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of impact of ASD on the family and society.",

Genetics has come to be an important aspect of research in almost every field of Neuroscience and Psychology ranging from neural development to cognitive function and dysfunction. However, many students have not had the opportunity to explore this in their studies to date. Therefore, the goal of this course is to provide students with the background needed to understand and think critically about the genetic components of Neuroscience and behavioral research. Numerous questions will be explored mainly through discussion of research papers. Lectures by the professor will fill in background knowledge needed to understand the readings. The questions explored will include: What are chromosomes and genes? What do they do? How do they do it? How do genes control development of the brain? How are single genes manipulated in animals to study their effects on behavior? How can genes associated with normal or abnormal behavior be identified? What has been learned from gene-behavior studies in animals? in humans? What do these studies tell us about the nature-nurture controversy? In addition to exploring these more traditional aspects of behavioral genetics we will address the 3 most exciting recent developments. These include the use of transgenic primate models, selective remote control of specific neural circuits using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and epigenetics, which helps explain how environmental factors and behavior itself can change gene activity and how these changes may be transmitted from one generation to the next. Many behaviors could be used to explore the principles these questions address. The readings will be selected from papers that focus on learning & memory and mental illness. However, if students are interested in other behaviors, papers that involve those behaviors and serve our purposes can be substituted. Grading will be based mainly on informal presentations of papers and participation in discussions of these papers. Permission of department required.",

This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD.

Audiologists also practice in a medical setting and thus must be comfortable with the medical approaches and terminology used by otolaryngologists, otologists, neuro-otologists, pediatricians, radiologists, anesthesiologists and other physicians.

In this course, we will examine the emergence of race and ethnicity as concepts, and how they shape our everyday lives. We will be guided by the following questions: Why do we study race and ethnicity? How and why are they relevant in our society? How do we experience race and ethnicity, and how has this changed over time? Topics include multiculturalism and diversity; media representations; racism and discrimination; colorism; racial hierarchies; immigration; and different domains of racial inequality.",

What is globalization and what is its relationship with development? How have the processes of global development produced inequalities among nations, regions, races, genders, and classes? Is there a \"developing\" world and a \"developed\" world? If so, what are their differences and how do they relate with each other? How have some developing countries become more developed than others? What roles do corporations, the state, and civil society organizations play in the processes of global development? How is global development interrelated with the physical environment, inequalities of consumption, and the environmental crisis? How do people resist the inequalities and perceived injustices of global development through global social movements? How are we interconnected economically, politically, culturally, socially, and ecologically with people all over the world? What are the possible futures of development? To address these issues, our focus will be on the developing world, our scope will be global and long-term, our methodology will be historical-comparative, and our perspective will be social-scientific and critical.",

The course will then look at principles and tools for tasks like organizing data ('tidy data'), manipulating data ('data carpentry'), querying data (through topics like regular expressions) as well as visualizing data (including interactive visualizations). The material and the homework will encourage development of modular reusable code and reproducible research through ideas such as object-oriented programming and dynamic documents in R Markdown. The last part of the course will study statistical procedures such as least-squares regression, LASSO, Monte Carlo sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Multiple systems concepts and methods have been developed to address these situations, and typical courses in systems focus on a relatively small portion of the rich assortment of available approaches to addressing systems problems. This course introduces students to multiple systems concepts and methods via readings and class lecture. The students then apply these concepts and methods on team-based projects. The course will emphasize critical thinking about how the concepts and methods are applicable to the problematic situations of the projects and how well the project teams were able to perform the required activities.",

This course is intended to be taken early in a graduate student's curriculum and therefore is designed to be a bridge between the student's previous experience with engineering (education, work, and teaching) and new engineering education research-based approaches.  It is intended as an entryway to help students apply an engineering design approach to the design of instruction.  To meet this aim, the course involves an iterative project-based approach in a context (design site) that is chosen by the student for its relevance, interest and potential application.",

Design cognition and learning is an area of engineering education research that seeks to understand what designers know and how they learn, and what tools best support design activity (e.g., collaboration, innovation, etc.). This research draws from many perspectives including cognitive psychology and the learning sciences, organizational learning, engineering and product design, architecture, human-centered interaction, and creativity and innovation. Themes in the course include (1) design knowledge, (2) what theories help understand design knowing and learning, (3) what are ways to study designers and design activity, and (4) how may design research inform design education and practice?

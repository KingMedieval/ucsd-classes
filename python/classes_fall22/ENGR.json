Students develop engineering approaches to systems, generate and explore creative and innovative ideas, and use of computational methods to support design decisions. In particular, the students will develop the ability to model and investigate physical systems at the microscopic and macroscopic levels with a focus on vectors analysis, linear momentum, angular momentum, work-energy, and solid material interactions. Design challenges and projects will explore a wide range of natural phenomena experimentally and computationally (utilizing Matlab and Python) and engage students in innovative thinking across the engineering disciplines at Purdue. They will learn the basics of descriptive statistics, data analysis, sensitivity analysis, and decision making. Students experience the process of design and analysis in engineering including how to work effectively in teams. Students also develop skills in project management, engineering fundamentals, oral and graphical communication, logical thinking, and modern engineering tools. Typically offered Fall.",

The course approaches these themes through discussion of: the relation and interaction of engineering, science, technology, and society; the historical origins and development of engineering as a profession; diversity issues in engineering and other STEM fields; engineering in cross-national/cultural contexts; and contemporary challenges related to globalization, ethics, and sustainability. In summary, the course is designed to help students understand what it means to identify as, and/or work with, engineers. Recitation sections and/or independent projects (at the instructor's discretion) provide further opportunities for students to expand their knowledge and improve their skills in relation to course themes.",

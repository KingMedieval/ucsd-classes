The second part focuses on issues surrounding the building controls: interfacing components such as sensors and actuators, problems encountered, and state-of-the-art solutions for building energy efficiency and thermal comfort. The third part aims to develop students' ability to convert control system concepts into real building control systems. The course provides a hands-on opportunity for students to complete three projects associated with the three primary components during the semester: indoor environmental quality assessment, building HVAC system commissioning and its control analysis, and new control algorithm development for building energy efficiency, occupant health, and individual productivity.",

Energy accounting procedures for all major building subsystems are covered in detail, along with operational cost analysis of these systems. Students learn fundamental techniques for auditing the building envelope; electrical and lighting systems; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems; internal thermal loads; and building maintenance and operation procedures. Students also learn to analyze electric and natural gas utility tariffs and rate structures and apply their findings to the energy auditing process.",

Techniques are drawn from multiple schools of thought such as business, design, engineering, and the social sciences. Over the course of the term, multidisciplinary student teams directly apply cumulative learning to address a real-world complex societal challenge in close collaboration with a partner organization in an experiential learning format.

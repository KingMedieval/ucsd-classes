        "description": "This course is intended for students in science or engineering. The components of the course consist of an overview of solar system objects and an overview of the physical processes that control the evolution of solar system objects since formation. The overview of solar system includes observations of the Sun, planets, asteroids and Kuiper-belt objects, comets, and interplanetary dust. Specific processes that are discussed include hydrostatic equilibrium, orbital dynamics, radioactive decay, and heat flow. The role of these processes in shaping planetary surfaces and atmosphere is explored.",

        "description": "Intended for science and engineering majors. Basic physics and math knowledge will be assumed. The picture of how the Universe came to be and how it has evolved has recently come into sharp focus. This progress is the result of improved observational techniques that have resulted in high resolution images of very distant galaxies, a more accurate mapping of the Large Scale Structure of the Universe or the high resolution picture of the young universe provided by Cosmic Microwave Background observations. We will present a historical perspective of how ideas and data have shaped Cosmology through the centuries. In addition, we will review the theoretical models that are in agreement with the current observations. Our goal will be to provide the students with a broad overview of the current research in Cosmology with an eye toward stimulating the students curiosity about the many questions still awaiting answers in this field.",

During the 3-week class, students will have 1-1.5 hours to work on a patient case in class and address challenges faced in the clinical setting. The second half of class will be used for students to present their recommendations to a \"medicine team\" (made up of your classmates and teachers). Students will be responsible for creating a pharmacist problem list and making verbal drug therapy recommendations. The majority of the grade will come from in-class participation with other points coming from online quizzes, communication exercises, and follow-up answers from clinical questions.",

The pharmaceutics principles are then applied to successively more complex liquid dosage forms: solution, emulsion, and suspension. The excipients that are required to prepare the dosage forms: buffers, preservatives, emulsifiers, suspending agents, wetting agents, etc., and the method of preparing each dosage form in both a compounding and manufacturing setting are covered.",

Pharmacists must perform error-free pharmaceutical calculations. Correct calculations contribute as much to pharmaceutical care as the newest methods/guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. The development of problem solving skills with pharmaceutical calculations is an important component of this course. In addition, practice and repetition of problems is necessary to develop confidence as well as accuracy. Appropriate documentation of work/set up and numerical answers (including units) is required. Approaches to minimize errors and maximize accuracy with pharmaceutical calculations are emphasized.",

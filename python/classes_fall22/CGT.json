Students act in an executive role with students in other project-oriented classes and in so doing cultivate supervisory production experience. Each student must engage with instructors and students to hone real-world hard and soft skills through situated experiences and student-led teaching opportunities. Student producers must develop a functioning development pipeline, meet regularly with their teams, and maintain industry-standard documentation and project management processes.

A thorough understanding of how game engines work is therefore a requisite element of the game development process and lever for research in most domains involving interactive simulations and games. As game engine development, research, and application is a large and complex topic, the course is split into two semesters of study. The two courses are structured similarly but cover different aspects of development on and within game engines. This course introduces students to the fundamental technologies and skills required to develop video games using a modern game engine. Students are taught using a student-led, active-learning pedagogy in which students co-develop and present lectures, demonstrations, and assignments for their peers, with facilitation by the course instructor. The focus of this course is primarily on the technical, functional, and theoretical dimensions of game development, prioritizing technical soundness over design and creativity (which are covered more explicitly in a separate course). As research in this field continues to rapidly iterate, the latest findings are incorporated into each new offering of the course, refreshing its content as the technology evolves in its implementation and theoretical underpinnings. Production of original research focused upon an aspect of game development or game engine design is required.",

Visual analytics is the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces that synthesize human and computational ability to attack large complex problems. It is concerned with analytical reasoning, interaction, data transformations, data visualization, analytic reporting, and technology transition. While the different visual analytics applications share common theories and strategies, each of them has its unique data composition, visual representations, and analytical needs and strategies. Through survey and study a broad range of visual analytics applications, students will be able to apply visual analytics on their own applications, analyze and break down a complex analytical problem into proper components and steps, evaluate different visual analytic techniques and strategies, and finally design and develop an effective visual analytics solution toward the problem.",

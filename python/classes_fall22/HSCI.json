This course will explore strategies managing an effective health and safety program within an organization. Management strategies will be viewed from multiple perspectives. In relation to the frontline employee, topics will be explored to help engage employees in safe behaviors and dealing with situations in which failures occur, resulting in accidents. The upper management perspective will focus on the establishment of a safety management system and effective techniques for measuring and reporting safety performance. A final perspective will consider both the frontline employee and upper management. This perspective will explore strategies to establish a positive safety culture within an organization to bring the frontline employees and upper management together in their vision of a safe and health workplace.",

In Part I students will observe and review the weekly MRI QA tests performed by the MR Technologists  on clinical MRI scanners and be involved with data analysis of these tests (image quality assessment, reporting). Annual MRI system performance evaluations of different clinical scanners will be observed and discussed. This includes assessing magnetic field homogeneity, slice position accuracy and slice thickness accuracy, and performance of radio frequency coil tests on the various coils available at different clinical MRI sites in the Indianapolis area. Students will also work as a team with the instructors on a course project to develop and evaluate advanced MR QA methods and procedures. Prerequisites: HSCI 57000.

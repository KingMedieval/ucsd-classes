        "description": "This course surveys a range of global issues to develop an understanding and appreciation of the major geographical and cultural areas of the world and the issues that both unite and divide such areas and their people. The course will examine key political, economic, social, historical and cultural patterns that define our modern world. It encourages students to raise 'big' questions about what processes and institutions helped constitute the modern moment, as well as about the dynamic interactions between our social world and the natural one. This is a gateway course for prospective Global Studies Majors and Minors.",

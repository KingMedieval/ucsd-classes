This course is specially designed to enhance students' quantitative reasoning and skills through discussions of issues in educational data and authentic data analysis experiences of a variety of education data. The topics to be covered in this course include simple/multiple linear regression, different types of group comparison methods (including n-way ANOVA, ANCOVA, Repeated-measures ANOVA, and Mixed ANOVA). The course is specifically designed: 1) to understand how the quantitative methods covered in the course can be used appropriately to address proposed research questions in education, and 2) to interpret quantitative results meaningfully for a given context. It is expected that all students who enroll in this course have completed at least one semester of introductory statistics course (e.g. STAT 50100 or equivalent). Permission of instructor required.",

Students will then be divided into interdisciplinary teams with members from both universities and provided a prompt related to the semester's theme. Teams will spend several weeks of the course focused on researching, developing, and packaging their solutions, before presenting them publicly at the end of the term. In addition to increasing knowledge of the topic and improving teamwork skills, students in this course will advance in intercultural knowledge, skills, and attitudes through their international collaborative experience.",

Furthermore, we will explore the musical language of jazz with its power to make collective performance stronger. And we will investigate the ways in which this artists' talk became the \"talk of the town\" and country as a medium through which people could break from dominant cultures. We will make sense of and process our journey by creating our own jazz ensemble, featuring the layered textures of our lives as inspiration for the note and lyric.",

We will ask ourselves how relations of power inform the ways technologies are designed and experienced, as well as how power shapes dominant and insurgent approaches to achieving technological justice.

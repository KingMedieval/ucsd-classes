During the first section, we will discuss the cellular and organismal events that occur following virus infection, including viral entry, replication, modulation of cell biology by viral proteins, the host immune response to infection, evasion of the immune response by viruses, and resulting virus-induced disease. The emphasis of this first section will be on the general strategies used by viruses to establish and maintain infection in a population. In the second section, we will discuss in relative detail our current understanding of select important human viruses including influenza, HIV, smallpox, the herpesviruses, and tumor-causing viruses. The objective of this section will be to understand how the unique aspects of each virus's biology affect the outcome of infection with these pathogens. In addition to virus-associated diseases, we will discuss potential ways that viruses may provide symbiotic benefits to their hosts and thereby shape the course of human evolution.  Throughout the course, we will emphasize societal and political aspects of virology and virus-derived technologies, including vaccine development, the use of viruses as gene therapy vectors, and the threat of viral bioterror of bio-error.",

        "description": "This course is a continuation of BIOL 66200 and expands the introduction for incoming graduate students to methods of seminar presentation and critique and to various guidelines for professional development during their graduate school experience. Topics include seminar topic selection and 20-minute seminar design, tutorials on electronic services at the PU Library and Citation Management programs, and evaluating classmate presentations. Using the skills learned the previous semester, each student is required to make a 20-minute PowerPoint presentation to the class, based on a pre-approved topic of their choice. The speaker is asked questions and the presentation receives written evaluations by all members of the class. Each student practices with the course instructor prior to the public presentation. The course also continues to socialize the incoming cohort of students among themselves and with more senior students in the broad range of research disciplines available.",

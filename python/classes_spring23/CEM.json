Working in teams in a realistic engineering practice environment, students use an actual construction project to accomplish open-ended project planning and systems design. Course covers construction project strategy, cost estimating and bidding, constructability analysis, project scheduling, contract conditions, project organization, site analysis and development, safety and quality management, and information systems design. Comprehensive written submittals and oral presentations require integration of knowledge gained in previous courses and in construction internships.",

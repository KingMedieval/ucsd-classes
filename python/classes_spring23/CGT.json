Students will learn what the data-flow programming model is, and how to write vertex, geometry, tessellation, and fragment shaders. Another output is using texturing and lighting on the low level of the GPU and the next step is to provide animations using vertex shaders.

A thorough understanding of how game engines work is therefore a requisite element of the game development process and lever for research in most domains involving interactive simulations and games. As game engine development, research, and application is a large and complex topic, the course material is distributed across two semesters. In addition to the continuation of technical topics this course also emphasizes the experiential, conceptual, and aesthetic dimensions of game development, prioritizing implementation completeness with creative, aesthetically-pleasing implementations that are informed by current research. As research in this field continues to rapidly iterate, the latest findings are incorporated into each new offering of the course, refreshing its content as the technology evolves in its implementation and theoretical underpinnings. Production of original research focused upon an aspect of game development or game engine design is required. Permission of instructor required.",

The goal is to introduce visualization as a tool, explore and identify which visualization tools are better suited to visualize different types of data, and understand the role visualization plays in understanding what the data represent. This course gives students an in-depth view of the various branches of visualization and the visualization tools in each area. After taking the course students will be able to evaluate data visualization tools and determine which tool to use for different types of data.

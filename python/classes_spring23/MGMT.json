        "description": "Managers, regardless of your industry, will routinely face HR and employment issues that collide with the law. In this course, we will examine many laws and the practical ways you can stay on the right side of the law. Don't worry, you aren't in a law school class and I don't expect you to become employment attorneys. However, I will help you gain a working knowledge of employment laws including: The Civil Rights Act, ADA, ADEA, FMLA, FLSA, and a host of alphabet soup. We will also apply these laws from posting a job description to recruiting to hiring to employee reviews to terminating an employee. While I can't guarantee you will never be sued by a disgruntled current or former employee, I can help you put yourself and your company in the best possible position to defend that suit. And don't worry: we will look at lots of quick case studies (less than a page) to give you context you can easily remember.",

The course covers valuation of securities using modern martingale methods as well as the necessary parameter estimation and numerical methods such as Monte Carlo simulations. Applications will include derivatives such as options on stocks, bonds and currencies, as well as valuation of defaultable securities, and modeling the term structure of interest rates and risk management with Value-at-Risk.

The theoretical topics include spectral and singular value decompositions, maximum likelihood and stochastic inversion, Backus and Gilbert theory, Green's function and linear operators, and the physics of layered media. Geophysical applications include seismic tomography, deconvolution, gravity and magnetics, earthquake sources, geodetics, and remote sensing. Offered in alternate years. Prior course work in advanced differential equations, physics, and chemistry of the earth is required.",

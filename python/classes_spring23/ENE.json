        "description": "This course examines theories of human development, learning and epistemology in the context of Engineering Education. A broad survey of readings guides an in-depth study of fundamental theories of development and knowledge generation as it relates to pedagogy and research. A rich body of theoretical literature will be studied in order to explore its relation to engineering education. Work in the course aims to construct answers to the following three questions: (1) How do theories of human learning, development, and epistemology help us think about engineering? (2) How do they relate to engineering education? (3) How do they inform research method and practice in engineering education? No restrictions. It is helpful, however, for students to have engaged in prior reading-and writing- intensive courses that required them to synthesize large amounts of information. For this reason, it is recommended that students are enrolled currently in a graduate program at Purdue University. Permission of department required.",

This course is intended to be taken early in a graduate student's curriculum and therefore is designed to be a bridge between the student's previous experience with engineering (education, work, and teaching) and new engineering education research-based approaches.  It is intended as an entryway to help students apply an engineering design approach to the design of instruction.  To meet this aim, the course involves an iterative project-based approach in a context (design site) that is chosen by the student for its relevance, interest and potential application.",

The course emphasizes engineering and globalization from the perspectives of the emerging Asian economies and Europe, as well as the United States. This course is designed for practicing engineers and engineering educators.  It is taught within a learner-centric, highly interactive, collaborative learning environment in which students are expected to learn from the experiences and thinking of each other, as well as from the instructor, and other course resources. The course places emphasis on reading, writing, web-based research, and discussion. Students are recommended (but not required) to have a minimum of two years work experience as a practicing engineer and strong communication skills (self-assessed).

The course will describe techniques for diagnosing organizations and interventions for improving organizations. Specific interventions will be examined in detail including structural interventions (e.g., organizational design, job design), interpersonal process interventions (e.g., process consultation, team building), and human resource interventions (e.g., performance management, career development). The course will attempt to both build knowledge and provide practice in the various techniques. The course will not duplicate material in other current course offerings by this professor, and it will not require prior courses in human resources.",

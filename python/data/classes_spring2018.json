The emphasis of this first section will be on the general strategies used by viruses to establish and maintain infection in a population.  In the second section, we will discuss in relative detail our current understanding of select important human viruses including influenza, HIV, smallpox, the herpesviruses, and tumor-causing viruses.  The objective of this section will be to understand how the unique aspects of each virus's biology affect the outcome of infection with these pathogens.  In addition to virus-associated diseases, we will discuss potential ways that viruses may provide symbiotic benefits to their hosts and thereby shape the course of human evolution.

Mass spectrometry is covered in some depth, and a number of newer aspects of particle spectroscopy are treated, including ion scattering spectrometry, Rutherford scattering, energy loss spectrometry (ion and electron), ion kinetic energy spectrometry, ion cyclotron resonance and Auger spectrometry. Applications of these techniques feature structural analysis (compositions of mixtures, molecular structure of organics, electronic state assignment in simple ions), chemical preparations (ion implantation), and isotopic analysis. The underlying chemistry is explored, particularly in considering the kinetics and dynamics of unimolecular fragmentation and in terms of the factors that affect the cross-sections of inelastic collisions.

This course is designed to give the student an understanding of both legal and economic principles and the relationship between them.

A broad survey of readings guides an in-depth study of fundamental theories of development and knowledge generation as it relates to pedagogy and research. A rich body of theoretical literature will be studied in order to explore its relation to engineering education. Work in the course aims to construct answers to the following three questions: (1) How do theories of human learning, development, and epistemology help us think about engineering? (2) How do they relate to engineering education? (3) How do they inform research method and practice in engineering education? No restrictions. It is helpful, however, for students to have engaged in prior reading-and writing- intensive courses that required them to synthesize large amounts of information. For this reason, it is recommended that students are enrolled currently in a graduate program at Purdue University. Permission of department required. Typically offered Spring.",

We will consider different varieties of creole languages and (their) cultures including English-based creoles in West Africa such as Kru (Liberia and Sierra Leone), Nigerian Pidgin and Cameroonian Pidgin; in the Caribbean such as Jamaican, San Andreas, Nicaraguan and Limonense, contrasting them with the Spanish-based creole Palenquero; and the three most predominant creoles in the U.S. - Louisiana Creole, Gullah and Hawaii Creole, to understand their characteristics and their history. We will explore the ways in which the languages manifest in the music and literature of the contexts where they are spoken. Finally, we will consider the African diaspora as a fundamental thread that ties (English-based) creole languages and peoples together. In exploring these issues, the course will draw on a variety of theoretical concepts and traditions from sociolinguistics, creole studies and African American studies.

        "description": "Historically, toxicology has been defined as the study of the adverse effects of xenobiotics. Today, toxicology encompasses much broader areas, including the study of endogenous compounds, physical agents, and even using toxicants as research tools. Basic and introductory toxicology courses cover the principles of toxicant metabolism and target organ toxicity. This course, Analytical Toxicology and Toxicologic Pathology is focused on the research and clinical applications of these principles. Two major areas will be covered: (1) principles of toxicant detection in biological matrices and (2) the assessment of pathological effects caused by toxicant exposure in biological systems. Laboratory sessions associated with each major topic allow students to have hands-on experience in these advanced analytical and pathological technologies. This course provides a unique opportunity for students to learn techniques that research and clinical toxicologists use daily in scientific or clinical laboratories. The course is suitable to both graduate and upper-class undergraduate students who are interested in toxicology, forensic science, veterinary medicine, environmental and occupational health, food toxicity, pharmaceutical drug testing, medical laboratory science, and general human and children's health.

We will cover ideas that provide insights into, for example, new product development, entrepreneurship or designing HR policies. To name a few examples of projects we will discuss, SAP's points-based system to encourage carpooling that helps the company save on large gas expenses; at challenge.gov, the Whitehouse encourages innovative solutions through crowdsourcing; and at companies like Google, and Best-Buy, employees participate in information assimilation games called prediction markets providing information to senior managers about ongoing projects. In this course, you will examine the mechanisms behind designing for human instincts and thereby developing an understanding of their effective use in the modern firm. Gamification is one form of design for human instincts. In order for any design to be effective, it should involve clearly defined strategies and well managed execution. To identify effective strategies, and metrics for the application of techniques to business, this course will draw upon interdisciplinary source material as well as real-world case studies. It will also identify a number of significant pitfalls to techniques, as well as notable legal and ethical issues, and the problems with implementing radical change in established firms. As a part of this class, you will be designing, playing, and evaluating various games. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

A principle theme throughout the course is that the solution of all self-care problems (i.e., regardless of the context in which they occur) involves the application of the same basic problem solving process.  Course activities, readings and homework assignments will provide students with illustration of how the problem solving process can be applied to specific self-care situations that arise in practice.

Each learning goal was expanded to finer-grained target ideas creating more steps to make concepts more understandable and explicit.  Activities were designed to enable students to develop deep conceptual understanding of each target area and the structure and sequence were guided by research on student learning.  In this class social interactions are used to clarify ideas and to encourage peer teaching.  The students' understandings are based on prior knowledge.  The class is based on a constructivist framework where new understandings are scaffolded from partial to incomplete understandings, and those are refined over time. Typically offered Fall Spring.",

By way of a set of case studies, students will analyze the features of these challenges which make them complex, and seek to explain and find solutions to the problems that arise in each case. Their treatment of the cases will be informed by published research and computer simulation. Students will actively participate in discussions regarding these global challenges, and contribute to the progress of the class using oral and written presentations. The course will culminate with a final project completed by teams composed of students from different disciplines. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

We will explore reactions to, and the results of, the spread of American culture both inside and outside the United States. By studying traditional cultural forms like art, music, design, literature, film, and technology the course will build a foundation from which to understand the configuration of American culture. Yet the course will also emphasize American culture expression, that in the forms of television, advertising, sport, cartoons, social media, video games, fashion, food, drugs, and automobiles, have transcended the geographical boundaries of the United States to engage in global interplays of material cultural exchange.

Almost everyone has heard of the human genome project, but fewer are aware of the spectacular technical progress in this field and the fact that many thousands of genomes have been sequenced.  Until recently, most of these have been microorganisms, but technological and computational progress has made it progressively easier and cheaper to sequence the genomes of higher organisms.  This field may have more of an impact on your future lives than almost any other field of the life sciences -  mostly because it touches on all areas of study.  The course will focus on the impact that genomes will have in selected areas.  It will begin with a basic understanding of the science and technology that gave rise to our current capabilities in sequencing and the fact that technology continues to provide greater capacity and cheaper prices.  You will soon see that every field in the College of  Science is well represented in the science and technology.  We will then go on to see how genomics influences many topics that affect our daily lives and can possibly provide answers to some critical questions (or at least pose better questions):  What is the basis of personalized medicine?  What does genomics tell us about the genealogy of mankind?  What impact will genomics have on our future food supply and our ability to feed a population of 9 billion people? What is the human microbiome and what does that mean to me?  Similarly, what is the gut microbiome, the mouthmicrobiome, etc? What impact will genomics have on the development of alternative energy sources, especially biofuels? In every area, we will discuss the scientific challenges, but also the ethical and societal implications.  In most cases, there is no one right answer, but a series of choices that can be guided by ethical considerations.  Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

        "description": "The modern smartphone is enabled by a billion-plus nano-transistors, each having an active region that is barely a few hundred atoms long. Interestingly the same amazing technology has also led to a deeper understanding of the nature of current flow on an atomic scale. The aim of this course is to make the fundamentals of nanoelectronics accessible to anyone in any branch of science or engineering, assuming very little background beyond linear algebra and differential equations, although we will be discussing advanced concepts in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that should be of interest even to specialists. We first introduce a new perspective connecting the quantized conductance of short ballistic conductors to the familiar Ohm's  law of long diffusive conductors, along with a brief description of the modern nano-transistor. We then address fundamental conceptual issues related to the meaning of resistance on an atomic scale, the interconversion of electricity and heat, the second law of thermodynamics and the fuel value of information. Finally we introduce the concepts of quantum transport as applied to modern nanoscale electronic devices. Typically offered Fall.",

The pharmaceutics principles are then applied to successively more complex liquid dosage forms: solution, emulsion, and suspension. The excipients that are required to prepare the dosage forms: buffers, preservatives, emulsifiers, suspending agents, wetting agents, etc. and the method of preparing each dosage form in both a compounding and manufacturing setting are covered.

We will also consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism.

One coverage centers around two lines of models that are closely related, the generalized linear models (GLM) for regression (and ANOVA) with non Gaussian responses, and survival models for the analysis of lifetime data. Among issues to be discussed are the estimation of the models, the testing of hypotheses, and the checking of model adequacy. Data examples will be used throughout the course to illustrate the methodologies and the related software tools in R.  Typically offered Fall Spring.",

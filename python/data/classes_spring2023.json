The second half of the course focuses on empirical price analysis. Popular time-series econometric tools are introduced to study price relationships over space and time, price discovery mechanisms, and functions of futures markets.",

Specifically, we will examine scholarship that either, 1) utilizes the transnational perspective in understanding history, the globe, and human behavior/interactions, or 2) utilizes transnational behaviors/ties as a variable to measurement adaptation. Materials in this course will examine - through the lens of race, ethnicity, class, gender, and sexuality - individual and comparative transnational case studies related to the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. This is a graduate seminar, and your active participation in discussions is mandatory. You will be asked to lead four seminar discussions on selected topics from the required readings, write three memos, and submit an extended book review.",

We will work together to examine the foundational scholarly literature in this area and how it is/ or is not reflected in construction of popular media. You will use this knowledge to construct both compelling oral science narratives, and a science story for popular consumption.",

The emphasis of this first section will be on the general strategies used by viruses to establish and maintain infection in a population. In the second section, we will discuss in relative detail our current understanding of select important human viruses including influenza, HIV, smallpox, the herpesviruses, and tumor-causing viruses. The objective of this section will be to understand how the unique aspects of each virus's biology affect the outcome of infection with these pathogens. In addition to virus-associated diseases, we will discuss potential ways that viruses may provide symbiotic benefits to their hosts and thereby shape the course of human evolution.  Throughout the course, we will emphasize societal and political aspects of virology and virus-derived technologies, including vaccine development, the use of viruses as gene therapy vectors, and the threat of viral bioterror of bio-error.",

Using the skills learned the previous semester, each student is required to make a 20-minute PowerPoint presentation to the class, based on a pre-approved topic of their choice. The speaker is asked questions and the presentation receives written evaluations by all members of the class. Each student practices with the course instructor prior to the public presentation. The course also continues to socialize the incoming cohort of students among themselves and with more senior students in the broad range of research disciplines available.",

Few biologists realize that when they can draw a picture of their system, or explain important pathways in words, that this is a model. From there, it isn't hard to start some basic math. The course will be a broad overview of different techniques that can be used to model biological systems. Each lecture topic in this course could itself form an entire course, so students will not complete the course as experts in mathematical modeling. Instead, the objectives are to: 1) expose students to a number of tools in mathematical modeling; 2) give students some practical experience with these tools; and 3) develop a component of their thesis research into a model.

Course content includes market analysis techniques to link technology attributes to opportunity and vice versa, combinatorial business design and planning methods, strategic innovation theories, competitive analysis, methods of emergent strategy and risk mitigation, as well as examination of team building, firm influence and navigation, and organizational design principles. Emphasis throughout is placed on the implications of research and development uncertainty, long-lifecycle economics, and the management of subcontracts and multi-disciplinary teams often encountered when developing and delivering complex engineering outputs. Case studies are used to contrast the challenges faced when creating new businesses (entrepreneurial) with those encountered in attempts to grow an existing enterprise (intrapreneurial). Coursework and project activities also facilitate development of business acumen, and skill building in conceptual thinking, synthesis, and persuasive communication. This course is particularly relevant for engineering students intending to progress into managerial roles in technology or R&D driven organizations. This course can be counted toward the College of Engineering Minor in Innovation and Transformational Change and the Burton D.

A thorough understanding of how game engines work is therefore a requisite element of the game development process and lever for research in most domains involving interactive simulations and games. As game engine development, research, and application is a large and complex topic, the course material is distributed across two semesters. In addition to the continuation of technical topics this course also emphasizes the experiential, conceptual, and aesthetic dimensions of game development, prioritizing implementation completeness with creative, aesthetically-pleasing implementations that are informed by current research. As research in this field continues to rapidly iterate, the latest findings are incorporated into each new offering of the course, refreshing its content as the technology evolves in its implementation and theoretical underpinnings. Production of original research focused upon an aspect of game development or game engine design is required. Permission of instructor required.",

This course is designed to cover the essential elements of biochemistry traditionally covered in a two semester series. Topics to be covered include: Amino acids, peptides and proteins, molecular models and structure-function relationships, enzymes, enzyme kinetics and enzyme mechanisms, carbohydrates and carbohydrate metabolism, aerobic metabolism, lipids and membranes, lipid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism and integration and regulation of metabolism. Special emphasis will be placed on connections between biochemical principles and the fields of medicine, human health and disease, nutrition and biotechnology. This course should serve as excellent preparation for higher-level biochemistry courses as well as standardized pre-health professional exams. CHM 33900 was designed as the 4th semester of the 1-2-1 competency-based curriculum transformation in chemistry as it applies to pre-health professional and life science students at Purdue. However, this course is open to other students who meet the prerequisites.",

Emphasis is on the unity of the phenomena that underlie the preparation, manipulation, and analysis of ion and electron beams and on the analogies between inelastic reactions of ions and electrons, including those with both gaseous and solid targets. Mass spectrometry is covered in some depth, and a number of newer aspects of particle spectroscopy are treated, including ion scattering spectrometry, Rutherford scattering, energy loss spectrometry (ion and electron), ion kinetic energy spectrometry, ion cyclotron resonance and Auger spectrometry. Applications of these techniques feature structural analysis (compositions of mixtures, molecular structure of organics, electronic state assignment in simple ions), chemical preparations (ion implantation), and isotopic analysis. The underlying chemistry is explored, particularly in considering the kinetics and dynamics of unimolecular fragmentation and in terms of the factors that affect the cross-sections of inelastic collisions.

To make the distinction more precise, we prefer to use the term critical cross-cultural science education instead of science education when referring to the teaching and learning of science in the increasingly culturally diverse context of schools in the US. Critical cross-cultural science education is defined as the process of actively engaging students in collaborative inquiry about what science is; whose interests are served by science; who decides what science is and what gets funded as science; and what kinds of individual and collective roles individuals could play as informed and responsible citizens in supporting the advancement of science to benefit society.

A broad survey of readings guides an in-depth study of fundamental theories of development and knowledge generation as it relates to pedagogy and research. A rich body of theoretical literature will be studied in order to explore its relation to engineering education. Work in the course aims to construct answers to the following three questions: (1) How do theories of human learning, development, and epistemology help us think about engineering? (2) How do they relate to engineering education? (3) How do they inform research method and practice in engineering education? No restrictions. It is helpful, however, for students to have engaged in prior reading-and writing- intensive courses that required them to synthesize large amounts of information. For this reason, it is recommended that students are enrolled currently in a graduate program at Purdue University. Permission of department required.",

Students will then be divided into interdisciplinary teams with members from both universities and provided a prompt related to the semester's theme. Teams will spend several weeks of the course focused on researching, developing, and packaging their solutions, before presenting them publicly at the end of the term. In addition to increasing knowledge of the topic and improving teamwork skills, students in this course will advance in intercultural knowledge, skills, and attitudes through their international collaborative experience.",

Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic and biopharmaceutics properties of an NCE are critical to its selection as a lead candidate in a drug discovery program, its use as a functional research tool, and its use as a therapeutic agent. This course will be an overview of the development of pharmacokinetic principles, including guidelines for conducting clinical studies, and equations required to characterize the disposition of drugs and their metabolite(s). Students will develop the ability to probe the mechanisms and physiological processes responsible for ADME.

The course also addresses questions related to the ethics of retrieving linguistic data, the relations between the linguist and the speaking communities, and the use of the collected data.  A non-Indoeuropean lesser-studied language will be examined with the help of a native speaker of the language.  The main area of its grammar will be covered: phonetic and phonological system, inflectional and derivational morphology, basic syntactic structures and basic semantic phenomena.  The final goal is to obtain a basic grammatical description of the language.  Lab sessions will be directed towards the training in the software and audio and video tools used for the trade.

We will also apply these laws from posting a job description to recruiting to hiring to employee reviews to terminating an employee.

At the same time, we also would like to give our students the opportunity to apply their acquired classroom knowledge and have them exposed to some real-world accounting problems that start-up or established companies typically experience. Our students are expected to provide various accounting support services that are related to financial accounting & reporting, managerial accounting, business planning, and/or tax issues. The format of the course is very open. The first four weeks will be spent in a classroom setting, with presentations on how to professionally manage a client relationship and how to successfully tackle projects in a challenging STEM start-up and/or established corporate environment. Each project will be completed by teams of 3-5 students, which will be formed at the beginning of the semester. After the initial classroom sessions, the project teams will be on their own, with faculty guidance, running the engagement. The teams will meet with the clients to determine their needs and expectations. The students will do the work and deliver the output including a final presentation to the client.",

Most classes will begin with a guest speaker giving a brief introduction to a particular area or topic within philosophy. Students will have a short reading assigned for each class period that will be discussed with the instructor following the guest's presentation. The course readings will be, as best as possible, related to the area/topic introduced by the guest. Certain classes will be dedicated solely to career/professionalization interests and will feature guests with expertise in these areas. The professionalization experts will help students develop their career goals, identify possible internships and scholarships to pursue while a student at Purdue, and develop career goals for after they have graduated. Finally, certain classes will be dedicated to writing and the development of the final project, which will include a proposed 8-semester path of study, a polished resume/CV, and career/professionalization goals.",

The course will be divided into four units: 1) Matter and Interactions 2) Motion and Stability 3) Energy and 4) Waves and their applications. All of these units will be delivered through the paradigm of solving engineering design problems. Engineering design involves many different practices: problem definition, model development and use, investigation, analysis and interpretation of data, application of mathematics and computational thinking, and determination of solutions.",

Is it possible to identify distinct neurophysiological markers of your awareness of a particular sight, sound, taste, or touch? What is the cortical basis of your sense of being a self with a first-person point of view that is spatiotemporally grounded in a body? How does consciousness relate to attention and working memory? Does consciousness have an adaptive function? Might a person in a coma or a vegetative state still have some form of awareness? Could a computer or a robot ever have what we would consider to be genuine experiences? During the past few decades, these and other questions about the nature of consciousness have been the focus of increasing empirical and theoretical research in neuroscience and other disciplines. The main purpose of the course is to introduce students to this exciting field of inquiry by exposing them to a variety of representative books and articles in the literature. The \"backbone\" of the course will be Stanisla's Dehaenes Consciousness and the brain: Deciphering how the brain codes our thoughts (2014). As we go through the course, we will use each successive chapter in this book as the starting point for a deeper and wider exploration of the given topic(s), bringing into our discussion relevant experimental findings and philosophical perspectives from other investigators. Requirements: Students will take turns guiding discussions and will also write 1-2 page \"response papers\" to the weekly readings. Permission of department required.",

Additionally, the future clinician will be better served by recognizing how rapidly information changes in this arena and becoming comfortable with reliable educational resources that are available for life-long learning in this area. Audiologists also practice in a medical setting and thus must be comfortable with the medical approaches and terminology used by otolaryngologists, otologists, neuro-otologists, pediatricians, radiologists, anesthesiologists and other physicians. Additionally, audiologists may be the first contact with a hearing-impaired patient and their role in the referral process will be emphasized.",

In this course, we will examine the emergence of race and ethnicity as concepts, and how they shape our everyday lives. We will be guided by the following questions: Why do we study race and ethnicity? How and why are they relevant in our society? How do we experience race and ethnicity, and how has this changed over time? Topics include multiculturalism and diversity; media representations; racism and discrimination; colorism; racial hierarchies; immigration; and different domains of racial inequality.",

This course will introduce you to the study of global development and globalization. The primary questions we will address are: What is development? What is globalization and what is its relationship with development? How have the processes of global development produced inequalities among nations, regions, races, genders, and classes? Is there a \"developing\" world and a \"developed\" world? If so, what are their differences and how do they relate with each other? How have some developing countries become more developed than others? What roles do corporations, the state, and civil society organizations play in the processes of global development? How is global development interrelated with the physical environment, inequalities of consumption, and the environmental crisis? How do people resist the inequalities and perceived injustices of global development through global social movements? How are we interconnected economically, politically, culturally, socially, and ecologically with people all over the world? What are the possible futures of development? To address these issues, our focus will be on the developing world, our scope will be global and long-term, our methodology will be historical-comparative, and our perspective will be social-scientific and critical.",

The course exploits the broad expertise of the four faculty members by treating these challenges from diverse disciplinary perspectives, from the biological and physical sciences, to the social sciences, to engineering. By way of a set of case studies, students will analyze the features of these challenges which make them complex, and seek to explain and find solutions to the problems that arise in each case. Their treatment of the cases will be informed by published research and computer simulation. Students will actively participate in discussions regarding these global challenges, and contribute to the progress of the class using oral and written presentations. The course will culminate with a final project completed by teams composed of students from different disciplines.",

This course introduces students to multiple systems concepts and methods via readings and class lecture. The students then apply these concepts and methods on team-based projects. The course will emphasize critical thinking about how the concepts and methods are applicable to the problematic situations of the projects and how well the project teams were able to perform the required activities.",

This unique course brings together perspectives from technology and anthropology to address this by exploring ethnographic studies of people and technology interactions. Through this process, students will practice the problem scoping skills necessary to identify and define problems and begin to generate appropriate design solutions. In addition, students will learn how to observe and talk with people about technology and discuss a range of ways people use technology. Accordingly, the course will focus on human-centered design and how to empathize with people during the design process. This will allow students to learn how to identify opportunities for innovation that emerge when designers carefully observe and listen to humans using technology and/or experiencing problems with current technology.

        "description": "This course examines the evolution of American culture as the United States transitioned from a relatively isolated country at the end of the 19th century to an active shaper of a global community by the 21st century. We will examine ways in which American Culture shaped and was shaped by international relationships that transcend nation states. We will explore reactions to, and the results of, the spread of American culture both inside and outside the United States. By studying traditional cultural forms like art, music, design, literature, film, and technology the course will build a foundation from which to understand the configuration of American culture. Yet the course will also emphasize American culture expression, that in the forms of television, advertising, sport, cartoons, social media, video games, fashion, food, drugs, and automobiles, have transcended the geographical boundaries of the United States to engage in global interplays of material cultural exchange. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

However, recent technoscientific developments have altered this arrangement and have changed the ways sports are played. We have reached a place where heated competitions not only take place on the fields of play, but also within scientific and engineering laboratories. The fundamental question this project-based course will address is: how will new and emerging scientific knowledge and technological innovations transform sports?  We will explore topics ranging from football, baseball, basketball, and soccer, to e-sports, fantasy sports, and sports analytics. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

The course will be divided into two sections.  During the first section, we will discuss the cellular and organismal events that occur following virus infection, including viral entry, replication, modulation of cell biology by viral proteins, the host immune response to infection, evasion of the immune response by viruses, and resulting virus-induced disease.  The emphasis of this first section will be on the general strategies used by viruses to establish and maintain infection in a population.  In the second section, we will discuss in relative detail our current understanding of select important human viruses including influenza, HIV, smallpox, the herpesviruses, and tumor-causing viruses.  The objective of this section will be to understand how the unique aspects of each virus's biology affect the outcome of infection with these pathogens.  In addition to virus-associated diseases, we will discuss potential ways that viruses may provide symbiotic benefits to their hosts and thereby shape the course of human evolution.  Throughout the course, we will emphasize societal and political aspects of virology and virus-derived technologies, including vaccine development, the use of viruses as gene therapy vectors, and the threat of viral bioterror of bio-error.

Emphasis is on the unity of the phenomena that underlie the preparation, manipulation, and analysis of ion and electron beams and on the analogies between inelastic reactions of ions and electrons, including those with both gaseous and solid targets. Mass spectrometry is covered in some depth, and a number of newer aspects of particle spectroscopy are treated, including ion scattering spectrometry, Rutherford scattering, energy loss spectrometry (ion and electron), ion kinetic energy spectrometry, ion cyclotron resonance and Auger spectrometry. Applications of these techniques feature structural analysis (compositions of mixtures, molecular structure of organics, electronic state assignment in simple ions), chemical preparations (ion implantation), and isotopic analysis. The underlying chemistry is explored, particularly in considering the kinetics and dynamics of unimolecular fragmentation and in terms of the factors that affect the cross-sections of inelastic collisions.

The outcomes that emerge, and the value we create in the process, depends on those institutions and incentives. Economics is a broad and diverse body of ideas that helps us understand those everyday choices and the kinds of outcomes they generate. We will explore these economic ideas and the ways that institutions affect outcomes, from informal social norms all the way to big questions of social organization such as the contrast between capitalism and socialism. Our main method of exploring economic ideas will be communicating those ideas through writing, video, and other multimedia approaches; we will build and deepen our understanding of economic ideas in society by explaining them, applying them, and sharing them with others.

Work in the course aims to construct answers to the following three questions: (1) How do theories of human learning, development, and epistemology help us think about engineering? (2) How do they relate to engineering education? (3) How do they inform research method and practice in engineering education? No restrictions. It is helpful, however, for students to have engaged in prior reading-and writing- intensive courses that required them to synthesize large amounts of information.

Course activities, readings and homework assignments will provide students with illustration of how the problem solving process can be applied to specific self-care situations that arise in practice.

Specifically, the course is designed to introduce students to the appropriate selection and use of nonprescription medications and devices for the treatment of minor health complaints by patients.  A principle theme throughout the course is that the solution of all self-care problems (i.e., regardless of the context in which they occur) involves the application of the same basic problem solving process.  Course activities, readings and homework assignments will provide students with illustration of how the problem solving process can be applied to specific self-care situations that arise in practice.  Active learning methods will be employed to involve students directly in the actual application of this process to simulated practice problems.  Topics: Determined by students taking PHPR 48300.

How does energy flow through farming systems, and how do resources recycle (or not)? What are the weaknesses of farming systems that could be mitigated by mimicking natural systems? Issues of efficiency, sustainability and resilience will be investigated in the context of permaculture, a theory of food production and landscape design that has an emphasis on perennial crops, low input production, and ecological diversity. The centerpiece of the course will be to further develop the Purdue Student Farm using permaculture principles. Typically offered Spring.",

By way of a set of case studies, students will analyze the features of these challenges which make them complex, and seek to explain and find solutions to the problems that arise in each case. Their treatment of the cases will be informed by published research and computer simulation. Students will actively participate in discussions regarding these global challenges, and contribute to the progress of the class using oral and written presentations. The course will culminate with a final project completed by teams composed of students from different disciplines. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

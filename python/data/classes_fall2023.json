Analysis of multi-layer digital georeferenced crop data is used to inform the development and evaluation of zone-specific agronomic input prescriptions. Variables include factors affecting soil productivity, soil fertility and N management (including emerging sensor and crop modeling technologies). Prescriptions for variable crop genetics and seeding rates are also discussed. Sound agronomic use of emerging technologies such as real time soil moisture, organic matter, temperature and moisture sensing to affect variable seeding depth, rate and precision are included.  May be used in combination with AGRY 49800 to meet the Agronomy undergraduate capstone requirement; will also meet the GIS/GPS requirement in Agronomy plans of study.",

We will explore reactions to, and the results of, the spread of American culture both inside and outside the United States. By studying traditional cultural forms like art, music, design, literature, film, and technology the course will build a foundation from which to understand the configuration of American culture. Yet the course will also emphasize American culture expression, that in the forms of television, advertising, sport, cartoons, social media, video games, fashion, food, drugs, and automobiles, have transcended the geographical boundaries of the United States to engage in global interplays of material cultural exchange.",

We will present a historical perspective of how ideas and data have shaped Cosmology through the centuries. In addition, we will review the theoretical models that are in agreement with the current observations.

The various disciplines in the life sciences are generating a wealth of experimental and annotation data. Today's graduate students need experience with modern tools that can help them to access, explore, analyze, interpret and manage the data that they generate in the lab. Students will use the R programming language and packages from Bioconductor, the R bioinformatics project, as their principal tools for this course. Students will develop workflows in R that bridge established algorithms for bioinformatics such as limma, edgeR or DESeq2, incorporating methods to import, QC, transform and visualize genome-scale datasets derived from next generation sequencing experiments. A critical aspect of bioinformatics that is often inadequate is workflow documentation. This course will use Rmarkdown to integrate computer code, data and results to manage complex bioinformatics projects. The class has lecture, lab and distance components. Lectures will focus on the theoretical and biological aspects of bioinformatics analysis using recent examples from the literature. In lab, students will work on programming exercises or projects using published datasets. Advanced students will also have the opportunity to work with their own data. Distance instruction will include R tutorials and videos that students can work through at their own pace (subject to completion deadlines). Particular emphasis will be placed on the theoretical and practical limitations of next generation sequencing data. No prior computer programming experience is required, but it is assumed that students have a firm grasp of the fundamental principles of molecular biology and how they relate to complex processes such as gene expression and genome organization.

Topics will include understanding the evolutionary organization of genes (genomics), the structure and function of gene products (proteomics), and the dynamics of gene expression in biological processes (transcriptomics). Inherently, bioinformatics is interdisciplinary, melding various applications of computational science with biology. This jointly taught course introduces analytical methods from biology, statistics and computer science that are necessary for bioinformatics investigations. The course is intended for junior and senior undergraduates from various science backgrounds. Our objective is to develop the skills of both tool users and tool designers in this important new field of research.",

Course content includes market analysis techniques to link technology attributes to opportunity and vice versa, combinatorial business design and planning methods, strategic innovation theories, competitive analysis, methods of emergent strategy and risk mitigation, as well as examination of team building, firm influence and navigation, and organizational design principles. Emphasis throughout is placed on the implications of research and development uncertainty, long-lifecycle economics, and the management of subcontracts and multi-disciplinary teams often encountered when developing and delivering complex engineering outputs. Case studies are used to contrast the challenges faced when creating new businesses (entrepreneurial) with those encountered in attempts to grow an existing enterprise (intrapreneurial). Coursework and project activities also facilitate development of business acumen, and skill building in conceptual thinking, synthesis, and persuasive communication. This course is particularly relevant for engineering students intending to progress into managerial roles in technology or R&D driven organizations. This course can be counted toward the College of Engineering Minor in Innovation and Transformational Change and the Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship (BDMCE) Certificate in Entrepreneurship and Innovation.",

A thorough understanding of how game engines work is therefore a requisite element of the game development process and lever for research in most domains involving interactive simulations and games. As game engine development, research, and application is a large and complex topic, the course is split into two semesters of study. The two courses are structured similarly but cover different aspects of development on and within game engines. This course introduces students to the fundamental technologies and skills required to develop video games using a modern game engine. Students are taught using a student-led, active-learning pedagogy in which students co-develop and present lectures, demonstrations, and assignments for their peers, with facilitation by the course instructor. The focus of this course is primarily on the technical, functional, and theoretical dimensions of game development, prioritizing technical soundness over design and creativity (which are covered more explicitly in a separate course). As research in this field continues to rapidly iterate, the latest findings are incorporated into each new offering of the course, refreshing its content as the technology evolves in its implementation and theoretical underpinnings. Production of original research focused upon an aspect of game development or game engine design is required.",

        "description": "This course is designed to introduce upper level undergraduate students in economics to the field of health economics. We will analyze health and health care theories, institutions, and key policy issues using tools from intermediate microeconomic theory. The course begins with an analysis of health care as a commodity and why health is different from other consumer goods. The course then examines the demand for and the production of health and health care, and the behavior and organization of health care providers. The discussion then switches to information asymmetries and the functioning of health insurance markets. Afterwards, the course turns to the analysis of government involvement in the health care system. The class concludes with an examination of medical care systems around the world, paying particular attention to the U.S. health care system.",

Hence, learning to teach science in this class will involve conceptualizing science as a verb and not as a noun. To make the distinction more precise, we prefer to use the term critical cross-cultural science education instead of science education when referring to the teaching and learning of science in the increasingly culturally diverse context of schools in the US. Critical cross-cultural science education is defined as the process of actively engaging students in collaborative inquiry about what science is; whose interests are served by science; who decides what science is and what gets funded as science; and what kinds of individual and collective roles individuals could play as informed and responsible citizens in supporting the advancement of science to benefit society.

We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of impact of ASD on the family and society.",

In this course, we will examine how the invention of calculating machines - analogue and then digital - has developed in tandem with philosophical and scientific theories of human thinking and intelligence. In their turn, the latter developed as a response to changing social, political, and economic currents.",

It, being your first or one of your first courses in the Honors College, is designed to help you hone some of the fundamental learning outcomes of an honors education: interdisciplinary thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving, research thinking, collaboration, and global awareness. You will also engage with the pillars of the Honors College and develop community within the Honors College. To accomplish these objectives, the course is simultaneously project-based and experiential. You will work in multi-disciplinary teams on applied research that emphasizes critical and multi-dimensional thinking about real-world problems. Through project-based learning, you will move your skills beyond identifying and understanding a problem to identifying and formulating solutions to that problem. The problem addressed in the course is local or global in scope and has social, economic, political, and/or environmental implications for our local and/or global community as well as begs a multi-disciplinary, innovative solution. Continuing in the vein of experiential learning and of building your honors ethos, you will attend events (some as a class, others individually) and participate in programs in the Honors College and across campus that embody the Honors College's pillars: Community and Global Engagement, Leadership, Research, and Interdisciplinary Academics. You will curate a schedule of events that take place during the semester and reflect on these experiences. Permission of department required.",

Managing intellectual property is about transforming a firm's ideas, know-how, etc., into learning, products, and ultimately cash flow. In Managing Intellectual Property, we examine this topic by viewing intellectual property as both a legal asset (property ownership) and business asset (value-adding). The focus of Managing Intellectual Property is on the integration of IP generation, IP protection, and strategizing functions of the firm in creating value with an IP portfolio.

        "description": "This course is designed to help students more effectively manage self, peers, teams, clients and firms in diverse organizational settings and lead change. People and leaders in organizations are constantly working with members of different backgrounds, social identities, and experiences, fostering increased attention to diversity and inclusion in an employment and organizational context. [1] For example, women represent over half of the labor for 57% (BLS, 2018) [2] but are severely under-represented at senior management levels and in high-paying technical and professional fields (Kossek & Buzzanell, 2018) [3]. Ethnic and racial minorities are also severely under-represented. The U.S. population is increasingly diverse as 40% of the population identifies as racial or ethnic minorities (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2019) including African-American (13.4%), Hispanic-American (18.3%), Asian-American (5.9%), American Indian or Alaska Native (1.3%), and European American (60%) as well as a growing number of individuals who identify with more than one race or ethnicity (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2019) [4]. Further, 26% of the population has some form of disability, and 16% are over the age of 65 (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2018). Many other minority groups can face workplace marginalization challenges such as veterans, minority religious group members (Muslims, Jews, Hinduism; Catholic; Latter-day Saints), immigrants, people with mental or intellectual disabilities, & LGBTQ persons (Stone, Lukaszewski, & Dulebohn, 2020)[5]. When leveraged effectively, these differences in social identity and values can help attract and retain talent, strengthen societal and community economic equality, support organizational and team effectiveness; but when overlooked, or mismanaged, these differences can increase turnover, conflict, stress, talent under-utilization, and harm career and work-life well-being, and productivity. The class focuses on management of gender and diversity for inclusion and equity from an individual employee, leader and team/organizational perspective in a workplace context. The goal of this class is to take a multi-level approach to help you learn how to lead the management of diversity and inclusion through a) improving your ability to work in diverse teams, as well as b) developing your ability to lead, develop, and implement strategies to foster cultural and structural change to support the management of gender and diversity toward enhanced organizational effectiveness. Men, as well as women, majority and minority individuals, will be able to leverage the skills taught in this course when making their own career decisions, as well as when managing, being managed by, or collaborating with others; or leading and changing organizations to support new ways of working. We integrate multiple levels and lenses to understand diversity and inclusion. From an individual leadership perspective, we tackle the question: \"Why does diversity matter in employing organizations and business, what is the state-of-the-art evidence-based knowledge, and what does it mean to me personally in my career and my leadership beliefs.\" Specifically, we focus on the business and social science processes - including attitudes toward in-groups and out-groups, stereotyping, identity, privilege, and power, intersectionality, discrimination, bias, equity influence opportunity, bystander awareness, and perspective taking - this affects how members of different social groups perceive and interact with one another. Since managing social identity increasingly involves managing work-life boundaries and work and non-work public and private selves, we will also learn about authenticity choices and social and public/professional identity boundary management. From an organizational and group perspective, we address the question: \"What are best practices for successful diversity management?\" We will focus on organizational and institutional structures and cultures and their relations to strategies for creating diversity through management practices; how to create an inclusive culture and positive climate for inclusion and talent management, and developing and retaining diverse talent and foster innovation and organizational effectiveness across multiple levels of intervention (individual, group, intergroup, organizational, and societal). We discuss how to conduct an organizational diagnosis of the current diversity climate and barriers and facilitators for creating a multicultural workplace and a flexible environment supportive of many identities, and how assumptions may vary across industry and cultural contexts.",

The course will start with an overview of linear elastic mechanics, move to rubber elasticity, and then viscoelasticity (concentrating on time-temperature superposition). We will also cover fluid dynamics and the rheology of non-Newtonian fluids. We will conclude with a section on deformation, yield, and fracture mechanisms (focusing on those phenomena that are unique to polymers such as rubber cavitation, drawing, and crazing).",

These questions will lead us to consider the future of food and food policy in the United States. Can Americans develop food policy that supports the agricultural economy AND promotes the consumption of healthy foods? Could our agricultural system support this? We will learn about and explore these questions with class discussions, debate, research, guest lectures, relevant documentary films, and thought-provoking readings that present a variety of viewpoints.

The focus of the course is on developing the ability to apply a general ethical framework to new and unique situations, including those arising from the global cultural context of modern engineering. The course covers how this ethical framework should be constituted, and provides practice in applying this framework to specific, concrete cases. Together, these components work toward your development as a better engineer and more responsible global citizen. The readings, case studies and exercises are geared towards the development of a well-researched original case study that you will present to the class, which is informed by your past experiences and future aspirations related to engineering.",

The course will be focused on learning physical science by doing science i.e. developing understanding by collaborative activities and discussion in the laboratory and lecture and communicating your ideas to others. The course will have one 50-minute lecture and two 110-minute laboratory meetings each week. The course content is consistent with the CAEP (Council for the Accreditation of Education Preparation) K-6 Elementary Teacher Preparation Standards (Standard 2: Understanding and Applying Content and Curricular  Knowledge for Teaching in Physical Science and Engineering Design) and the NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards) Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs) for the Physical Sciences (Physical Sciences PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4) as well as many of the Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs). The course will be divided into four units: 1) Matter and Interactions 2) Motion and Stability 3) Energy and 4) Waves and their applications. All of these units will be delivered through the paradigm of solving engineering design problems. Engineering design involves many different practices: problem definition, model development and use, investigation, analysis and interpretation of data, application of mathematics and computational thinking, and determination of solutions.",

During the past few decades, there has been an unprecedented increase in studies on these topics, due in large part to the widespread use of highly sensitive brain mapping techniques that enable researchers to identify relationships between particular brain areas and particular language functions. The findings that have been emerged from this recent explosion of research are exciting and important for several reasons. They provide fresh insights into the nature of the uniquely human capacity for language, and they have significant implications for understanding and treating language disorders that result from brain injury.",

The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history of ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associated with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of impact of ASD on the family and society.",

The focus, from both \"sides\" of the course will be the importance of niche marketing for farmers and chefs. This course is going to be tasty and fun!",

The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism.

In this course, we will examine the emergence of race and ethnicity as concepts, and how they shape our everyday lives. We will be guided by the following questions: Why do we study race and ethnicity? How and why are they relevant in our society? How do we experience race and ethnicity, and how has this changed over time? Topics include multiculturalism and diversity; media representations; racism and discrimination; colorism; racial hierarchies; immigration; and different domains of racial inequality.",

This course will introduce you to the study of global development and globalization. The primary questions we will address are: What is development? What is globalization and what is its relationship with development? How have the processes of global development produced inequalities among nations, regions, races, genders, and classes? Is there a \"developing\" world and a \"developed\" world? If so, what are their differences and how do they relate with each other? How have some developing countries become more developed than others? What roles do corporations, the state, and civil society organizations play in the processes of global development? How is global development interrelated with the physical environment, inequalities of consumption, and the environmental crisis? How do people resist the inequalities and perceived injustices of global development through global social movements? How are we interconnected economically, politically, culturally, socially, and ecologically with people all over the world? What are the possible futures of development? To address these issues, our focus will be on the developing world, our scope will be global and long-term, our methodology will be historical-comparative, and our perspective will be social-scientific and critical.",

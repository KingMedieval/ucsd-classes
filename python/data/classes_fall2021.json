We will explore reactions to, and the results of, the spread of American culture both inside and outside the United States. By studying traditional cultural forms like art, music, design, literature, film, and technology the course will build a foundation from which to understand the configuration of American culture. Yet the course will also emphasize American culture expression, that in the forms of television, advertising, sport, cartoons, social media, video games, fashion, food, drugs, and automobiles, have transcended the geographical boundaries of the United States to engage in global interplays of material cultural exchange.",

Students will learn how to organize data sets to optimize clarity and analytic possibilities while minimizing errors with examples drawn from the literature or biological databases. R will be taught starting with small-scale data such as drug sensitivity assays moving to genome-scale analyses such as gene expression and pathway analysis later in the course. These skills will be taught in the light of increasing data literacy and enabling reproducible research through clear documentation of data and communication of analyses. Relevant concepts from biology and statistics will be reviewed.",

The first part covers basic concepts, terminology, procedures and computations of control systems including block diagrams & transfer functions, open-loop & closed-loop control, control system modeling, time response, root locus techniques, design via root locus, and digital control systems. The second part focuses on issues surrounding the building controls: interfacing components such as sensors and actuators, problems encountered, and state-of-the-art solutions for building energy efficiency and thermal comfort. The third part aims to develop students' ability to convert control system concepts into real building control systems. The course provides a hands-on opportunity for students to complete three projects associated with the three primary components during the semester: indoor environmental quality assessment, building HVAC system commissioning and its control analysis, and new control algorithm development for building energy efficiency, occupant health, and individual productivity.",

A thorough understanding of how game engines work is therefore a requisite element of the game development process and lever for research in most domains involving interactive simulations and games. As game engine development, research, and application is a large and complex topic, the course is split into two semesters of study. The two courses are structured similarly but cover different aspects of development on and within game engines. This course introduces students to the fundamental technologies and skills required to develop video games using a modern game engine. Students are taught using a student-led, active-learning pedagogy in which students co-develop and present lectures, demonstrations, and assignments for their peers, with facilitation by the course instructor. The focus of this course is primarily on the technical, functional, and theoretical dimensions of game development, prioritizing technical soundness over design and creativity (which are covered more explicitly in a separate course). As research in this field continues to rapidly iterate, the latest findings are incorporated into each new offering of the course, refreshing its content as the technology evolves in its implementation and theoretical underpinnings. Production of original research focused upon an aspect of game development or game engine design is required.",

This course will introduce Visual Analytics through foundational theories and a broad range of techniques and tools, focusing on using visualization methods to reason and solve complex problems in a wide variety of applications. Visual analytics is the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces that synthesize human and computational ability to attack large complex problems. It is concerned with analytical reasoning, interaction, data transformations, data visualization, analytic reporting, and technology transition. While the different visual analytics applications share common theories and strategies, each of them has its unique data composition, visual representations, and analytical needs and strategies. Through survey and study a broad range of visual analytics applications, students will be able to apply visual analytics on their own applications, analyze and break down a complex analytical problem into proper components and steps, evaluate different visual analytic techniques and strategies, and finally design and develop an effective visual analytics solution toward the problem.",

The course analyzes disciplinary differences in approaching the ethical, the human, and environmental problems such as sustainability, development, biodiversity, global security, and climate change. Students will explore what it means to be ethical in and through an interrogation of our contemporary conceptions of what it means to be human. These interrogations in turn will prompt us to reconsider human creations such as knowledge, culture, and technology, which will push us to genuinely think how humans as a species situate their creations within the realm of what they call Nature. Students will be introduced to the history of environmental studies in the discipline, to the rise of what is now known as \"postcolonial ecocriticism\" to theoretical inquiry into modern technology, and to other recent developments in the fields of environmental studies.

This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD:  reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism.

The course begins by presenting the molecular basis for aqueous and lipid solubility of drugs, pharmacokinetic principles that are related to dosage forms, mechanisms by which excipients or manufacturing processes affect bioavailability, and chemical kinetics applied to the shelf-life of dosage forms. The pharmaceutics principles are then applied to successively more complex liquid dosage forms: solution, emulsion, and suspension. The excipients that are required to prepare the dosage forms: buffers, preservatives, emulsifiers, suspending agents, wetting agents, etc. and the method of preparing each dosage form in both a compounding and manufacturing setting are covered.

This will include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD:  reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism.

We will explore reactions to, and the results of, the spread of American culture both inside and outside the United States. By studying traditional cultural forms like art, music, design, literature, film, and technology the course will build a foundation from which to understand the configuration of American culture. Yet the course will also emphasize American culture expression, that in the forms of television, advertising, sport, cartoons, social media, video games, fashion, food, drugs, and automobiles, have transcended the geographical boundaries of the United States to engage in global interplays of material cultural exchange.

We will present a historical perspective of how ideas and data have shaped Cosmology through the centuries. In addition, we will review the theoretical models that are in agreement with the current observations.

Almost everyone has heard of the human genome project, but fewer are aware of the spectacular technical progress in this field and the fact that many thousands of genomes have been sequenced.  Until recently, most of these have been microorganisms, but technological and computational progress has made it progressively easier and cheaper to sequence the genomes of higher organisms.  This field may have more of an impact on your future lives than almost any other field of the life sciences -  mostly because it touches on all areas of study.  The course will focus on the impact that genomes will have in selected areas.  It will begin with a basic understanding of the science and technology that gave rise to our current capabilities in sequencing and the fact that technology continues to provide greater capacity and cheaper prices.  You will soon see that every field in the College of  Science is well represented in the science and technology.  We will then go on to see how genomics influences many topics that affect our daily lives and can possibly provide answers to some critical questions (or at least pose better questions):  What is the basis of personalized medicine?  What does genomics tell us about the genealogy of mankind?  What impact will genomics have on our future food supply and our ability to feed a population of 9 billion people? What is the human microbiome and what does that mean to me?  Similarly, what is the gut microbiome, the mouthmicrobiome, etc? What impact will genomics have on the development of alternative energy sources, especially biofuels? In every area, we will discuss the scientific challenges, but also the ethical and societal implications.  In most cases, there is no one right answer, but a series of choices that can be guided by ethical considerations.  Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

Each section begins by describing fundamental commonalities of a reproductive event in a variety of species.  This is followed by an emphasis on the difference in the details of that event among species.  Students will be strongly encouraged to initiate and participate in discussions related to course topics during class.  To gain a deeper understanding of physiological processes, students are asked to select a current research article related to reproductive physiology.  Students are then required to present an analysis of article to the class in a formal presentation.  Some of the topics to be covered in lecture include ovarian and testicular function, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, fertilization, establishment of the placenta, maternal support of pregnancy, parturition, and lactation.

Topics will include understanding the evolutionary organization of genes (genomics), the structure and function of gene products (proteomics), and the dynamics of gene expression in biological processes (transcriptomics). Inherently, bioinformatics is interdisciplinary, melding various applications of computational science with biology. This jointly taught course introduces analytical methods from biology, statistics and computer science that are necessary for bioinformatics investigations. The course is intended for junior and senior undergraduates from various science backgrounds. Our objective is to develop the skills of both tool users and tool designers in this important new field of research.",

Interestingly the same amazing technology has also led to a deeper understanding of the nature of current flow on an atomic scale. The aim of this course is to make the fundamentals of nanoelectronics accessible to anyone in any branch of science or engineering, assuming very little background beyond linear algebra and differential equations, although we will be discussing advanced concepts in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that should be of interest even to specialists. We first introduce a new perspective connecting the quantized conductance of short ballistic conductors to the familiar Ohm's  law of long diffusive conductors, along with a brief description of the modern nano-transistor. We then address fundamental conceptual issues related to the meaning of resistance on an atomic scale, the interconversion of electricity and heat, the second law of thermodynamics and the fuel value of information. Finally we introduce the concepts of quantum transport as applied to modern nanoscale electronic devices. Typically offered Fall.",

We will cover ideas that provide insights into, for example, new product development, entrepreneurship or designing HR policies. To name a few examples of projects we will discuss, SAP's points-based system to encourage carpooling that helps the company save on large gas expenses; at challenge.gov, the Whitehouse encourages innovative solutions through crowdsourcing; and at companies like Google, and Best-Buy, employees participate in information assimilation games called prediction markets providing information to senior managers about ongoing projects. In this course, you will examine the mechanisms behind designing for human instincts and thereby developing an understanding of their effective use in the modern firm. Gamification is one form of design for human instincts. In order for any design to be effective, it should involve clearly defined strategies and well managed execution. To identify effective strategies, and metrics for the application of techniques to business, this course will draw upon interdisciplinary source material as well as real-world case studies. It will also identify a number of significant pitfalls to techniques, as well as notable legal and ethical issues, and the problems with implementing radical change in established firms. As a part of this class, you will be designing, playing, and evaluating various games. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.",

This course will provide an introduction to diagnostic testing as a whole, with an introduction to differential diagnosis and the selection of diagnostic tests. The students will also have the opportunity to learn about different types of testing (lab, imaging, etc.) and how to critically judge information provided by various tests. Finally, the students will be introduced to several common laboratory tests that have wide application in the diagnosis and treatment of many different disease states.

Many growers are turning to controlled environment and hydroponic production methods to produce high-value crops in tight quarters.  High input costs can, however, be a limitation.  High value food plants and fish can be a natural marriage.  The waste disposal problem of the fish can become the nutrient supply to the plants.  Typically offered Fall.",

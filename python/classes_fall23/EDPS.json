Although the WAIS-IV and WISC-IV will be the primary foci of this course, other tests of achievement, cognitive ability, and neuropsychological functioning will be covered. Students will also (a) gain experience in preparing written reports of their interpretations of assessment results, (b) develop an understanding of the history and development of cognitive ability and neuropsychological tests, and (c) explore implications for intellectual and neuropsychological assessment with diverse populations.

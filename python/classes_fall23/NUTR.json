We will investigate and discuss the roles individuals, corporations, and federal, state, and other government agencies play in creating food policy, and how these stakeholders as well as complex sociological and economic factors influence the way Americans eat. These questions will lead us to consider the future of food and food policy in the United States. Can Americans develop food policy that supports the agricultural economy AND promotes the consumption of healthy foods? Could our agricultural system support this? We will learn about and explore these questions with class discussions, debate, research, guest lectures, relevant documentary films, and thought-provoking readings that present a variety of viewpoints. You will explore current, real-life problems and have an opportunity to develop potential solutions.",

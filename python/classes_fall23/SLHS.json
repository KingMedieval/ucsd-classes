The findings that have been emerged from this recent explosion of research are exciting and important for several reasons. They provide fresh insights into the nature of the uniquely human capacity for language, and they have significant implications for understanding and treating language disorders that result from brain injury.",

The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of impact of ASD on the family and society.",

For each of the hearing aid features that are discussed, we review (1) the need or potential benefit to the patient, (2) the engineering behind the feature, (3) research supporting its efficacy and effectiveness, (4) its limitations, and (5) how to conduct routine clinical measurements to document its functioning.",

Students share cases online with their peer students who will provide thoughtful responses and reflections based on their own experiences. This course also provides a summative assessment of the students' knowledge in the final two years of their education. Due to the highly complex nature of the cases, students must use past clinical experiences and knowledge learned in multiple courses in order to successfully present cases and to respond in thoughtful ways that contribute to the online learning environment. Permission of department required; must also be currently enrolled in SLHS 57900 or SLHS 67900 completing an audiology externship.",

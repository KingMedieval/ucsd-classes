        "description": "  This course introduces life cycle analysis concepts; every process and material involved in an object's life is accounted for in a system boundary to quantify the effect an item has on the world's environment. Students will become familiar with how materials are sourced from nature, how they are processed into components, how those components are assembled into consumer items, how the consumer item continues to require resources, and how the item is eventually disposed. Particular focus is given to how each of these topics impacts societies and environments at both local and global scales.",

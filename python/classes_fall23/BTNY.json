Lectures and laboratory exercises will cover mechanisms and processes of plant diversity, anatomy, morphology, cell biology, growth and development. Our goal is to convey how these levels of organization and processes contribute to the relative success of plants within and across environments. Throughout the course, an emphasis will be placed on how scientific data are collected and interpreted, and key experiments performed in the lab component will be used to illustrate this process.",

Lectures and laboratories will cover the structural parts that comprise the plant body including three major vegetative organs (roots, stems, and leaves) and a set of reproductive organs (flowers, fruits, and seeds). The goal of this course is to understand the internal organization of plants, to learn multiple lab techniques critical for plant science research, and to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills.",

Plant diseases are caused by the same types of microorganisms that cause disease in animals and humans and, as such, many of the principles that apply to human and animal medicine apply to plant diseases. It is the objective of this course to introduce students to the major types of plant pathogens (plant pathogenic bacteria, viruses, nematodes, and fungi), their basic biology and examples of the types of diseases they cause. It will be expected that students have knowledge in plant pathology.",
